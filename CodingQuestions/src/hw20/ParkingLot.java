Design a parking lot using object-oriented principles.

//assumptions
//the parking lot has multiple levels, each level has multiple rows of spots
//the parking lot can park motorcycles, cars, and buses
//the parking lot chas motorcycle spots, compact spots, and large spots
//a motorcycle could park in any spots
//a car can park in either a single compact spot or a single large spot
//a bus can park in five large spots that are consecutive and within the same row, it cannot park in small spots

//abstract class for vehicle, car, bus and motorcycle inherit.
//parkingspot to handle the different parking spot size
