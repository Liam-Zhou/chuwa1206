# Homework 15

- HW47 Testing



## What is Selenium?

- Selenium is a popular open-source tool used for automating web browsers. It provides a set of libraries and APIs that allow developers to interact with web browsers programmatically. 

- Selenium is primarily used for automating web application testing, but it can also be used for tasks such as web scraping, web-based administration, and automating repetitive tasks in web applications.

## What is Cucumber?

- Cucumber is a popular open-source tool used for behavior-driven development (BDD) in Java (and other programming languages). It allows developers and testers to write executable specifications in a natural language format (typically Gherkin) that can be easily understood by non-technical stakeholders. Cucumber facilitates collaboration between business stakeholders, developers, and testers by providing a common language to describe application behavior.

## What is JMeter?

- Apache JMeter is an open-source Java-based **performance testing** tool designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance of web applications. 

- It can be used to simulate heavy loads on servers, networks, or objects to test their strength or to analyze overall performance under different load types.

## What is the life circle of Junit?

- Setup -> Execution -> Assertion -> Cleanup -> Finalization

- @Before -> @BeforeEach -> @Test -> @AfterEach -> @AfterAll

## Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?

- Yes. @BeforeAll methods are executed only once.

## What is Mockito? What is its limitations? What kind of tools can help?

- Mockito is a popular open-source Java mocking framework used for creating mock objects in unit tests. 

- It allows developers to simulate the behavior of dependencies (such as classes, interfaces, or abstract types) during testing, enabling isolated testing of individual components without relying on real implementations of their dependencies.

- Mockito cannot mock final, static, private methods, or constructors, PowerMockito can help.

## What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?

- @Mock can create a mock object and predefine its behaviors later

- @InjectMocks will be used to annotate variable service, it will inject its dependent variables annotated by @Mock into that service.

## What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?

- Stubbing, in the context of mocking frameworks like Mockito, refers to the process of defining the behavior of mock objects when certain methods are called on them during testing. 

- Stubbing allows developers to specify how these mock objects should behave in specific scenarios, enabling controlled testing of the system under test.

## What is Mockito ArgumentMatchers?

- Mockito ArgumentMatchers are utility methods provided by the Mockito mocking framework to define flexible argument matching when stubbing or verifying method invocations on mock objects. 

- ArgumentMatchers allows developers to specify constraints on method arguments, such as exact values, any value, null, or custom constraints, making it easier to define behavior for methods with complex or dynamic parameters.

- e.g. anyString, anyInt, anyLong, anyObject, any, anyCollections, etc.

## What is Hamcrest Matchers?

- Hamcrest Matchers is a framework for writing matcher objects in Java. Matchers are objects that are used in testing frameworks like JUnit and Mockito to define assertions and expectations in tests. Hamcrest Matchers provides a fluent and readable way to express complex conditions or expectations in tests.

- e.g. equalTo, is, not, containsString, greaterThan, lessThan

## Do you know @Spy? What is the difference between @Spy and @Mock?

- `@Mock` creates a fully mock object, meaning that all methods are stubbed by default and have default behavior (usually returning `null`, `0`, or `false`). **You need to explicitly specify** the behavior of methods that you want to stub using Mockito's stubbing syntax.

- `@Spy` creates a spy (partial mock) of a real object, meaning that **the real behavior of the object is preserved for methods that are not stubbed**. You can still stub or verify specific methods of the spy object using Mockito's stubbing and verification syntax.

## What is assertion?

- Assertions are used to verify that the actual behavior of the system under test matches the expected behavior defined by the test.

## If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? What kind of tests are written by you? What is the purpose of each type of test?

| Type of Testing            | Purpose                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit Test                  | verify the correctness of **individual components**                              |
| Integration Test           | verify the **collaboration between components** or modules is correct            |
| Regression Test            | Ensure that after **changes, existing functionality is still correct**           |
| Performance Test           | verify the performance and **efficiency** of the system -> 200ms                 |
| Stress Test                | Ensure that the system can still work normally **under high pressure** -> 2K QPS |
| User Acceptance Test (UAT) | Ensure that the software **meets users' needs and expectations**                 |

- Primarily I will write unit tests and integration tests.
