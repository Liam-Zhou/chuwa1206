## 2. how do you do the debug?
breakpoints

## 3. What is DTO, VO, Payload, DO, model?
DTO (Data Transfer Object): An object that carries data between processes to reduce the number of method calls.
VO (Value Object): An object that contains values; used for read-only purposes.
Payload: The part of transmitted data that is the actual intended message.
DO (Data Object): An object that represents database entities.
Model: In MVC architecture, it represents the application data and business rules.

## 4. What is @JsonProperty("description_yyds") (不会的话，课上问)?
The @JsonProperty annotation is used in Jackson to map JSON property names with Java object fields. Here, description_yyds specifies the JSON field name to bind to the Java field.

## 5. do you know what is jackson?
```java
<dependency>
<groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
<artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
<version>2.13.3</version>
<scope>compile</scope>
</dependency
```
Jackson is a high-performance JSON processor for Java that provides functionality for serializing Java objects to JSON and deserializing JSON into Java objects.

## 6. What is spring-boot-stater? what dependecies in the below starter? do you know any starters?
```java
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
Spring Boot Starter is a set of convenient dependency descriptors that we can include in our application. The spring-boot-starter-web includes dependencies for building web applications using Spring MVC. It includes Tomcat as the default embedded container. Other starters include spring-boot-starter-data-jpa, spring-boot-starter-security, etc.

## 7. do you know @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST) ? could you list CRUD by this style?
```java
// Create
@RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST)
// Read
@RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
// Update
@RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.PUT)
// Delete
@RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
```

## 8. What is ResponseEntity? why do we need it?
```java
new ResponseEntity<>(postResponse, HttpStatus.OK);
new ResponseEntity<>(postResponse, HttpStatus.CREATED);
ResponseEntity.ok(postService.getPostById(id));
```
ResponseEntity is a type in Spring MVC that allows handling HTTP requests with a body, status code, and response headers. It offers flexibility to manipulate the HTTP response fully.


## 9. What is ResultSet in jdbc? and describe the flow how to get data using JDBC
ResultSet in JDBC is a table of data representing a database result set, which is generated by executing a statement that queries the database. To get data using JDBC: establish a connection to the database, create a statement, execute a query to get a ResultSet, and then iterate through the ResultSet to retrieve data.

## 10. What is the ORM framework?
An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. It helps in managing database operations through the object-oriented paradigm. Examples include Hibernate, JPA (Java Persistence API), and EclipseLink.

## 12. What is the serialization and desrialization?
Serialization: The process of converting an object into a byte stream, typically for storage or transmission to another system.
Deserialization: The reverse process, converting the byte stream back into an original object.

## 13. use stream api to get the average of the array [20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32].
```java
int[] array = {20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32};
double average = Arrays.stream(array).average().orElse(Double.NaN);
```
