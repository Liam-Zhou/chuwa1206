### 2. @Configuration vs @Bean
- @Configuration: define a class level bean source
- @Bean: define a method level bean source
### 3. handle exception in Spring
- Use descriptive error messages
- Use @ExceptionHandler to handle exceptions thrown by specific controller method.
- Use @ControllerAdvice to handle the exceptions globally across all the controllers.
### 4. validation in Spring
- import dependency
- add validation rule to payload
- add @valid to controller to apply the rule
### 5. actuator
A model that provides production-ready features to monitor and manage the spring boot application

### 2. Spring vs Springboot, what is the benefit of using SpringBoot
Spring is a lightweight framework that offers an elaborate environment for robust programming and configuration model for Java-based application.
Spring boot is a java-based framework that is best for creating stand-alone Spring-based aplications in a short period.

benefits of using spring boot:
- easy to develop the spring based applications with Java, reduce a lot of time on development
- provides lots of plugins to develop and test Spring boot applications very easily
- provides embedded HTTP servers like Tomcat to develop and test the web application
- provides plugins to work with databases easily.
### 3. IOC and DI
- IOC: Inversion of Control
- DI: Dependency injection
### 4. @ComponentScan
Use @ComponentScan along with @Configuration to specify the packages we want to be scanned to create the Bean source.
### 5. define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton
- xml: 
```
<bean id="dataNucleusChuwaNoComponent"
class="com.chuwa.springbasic.components.impl.Data
NucleusChuwaNoComponent"></bean>
```
- annotation: class-level: @Component @Service @Repository @Controller @ControllerAdvice. Method level: @Bean
### 6. @SpringbootApplication
Mark a configuration class that declares one or more @Bean methods and also triggers auto-configuration and component scanning.
### 7. define a bean
- Class level annotation: @Component @Service @Repository @Controller @ControllerAdvice
- Method level annotation: use @Bean with @Configuration together
- XML
### 8. default bean name for @Component and @Bean
the lowercase version of the class name and method name
### 9. @Component vs @Service and @Repository
@Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring managed component. @Service annotates classes at the service layer. @Repository annotates classes at the persistence layer.
### 10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean
@AutoWired
@Resource
@Inject
### 11. 3 ways to do dependency injection 
Constructor injection, setter injection, filed injection

Constructor injection is the best:
- Immutability
- test-friendly
- compatibility with Java records
- explicit dependencies
### 12. how to set bean is primary
@Primary indicates that a particular bean should be given reference when multiple beans are candidates to be autowired to a single-valued dependency.
### 13. BeanFactory and ApplicationContext
BeanFactory provided the configuration framework and basic functionality. ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it.
### 14. What is the Scope of a Bean
- singleton: the bean is created only once in the container and will exist throughout the entire lifecyle of the application
- prototype: created every time when it is required.
### 15. XML 
```
<bean id="dataNucleusChuwaNoComponent"
class="com.chuwa.springbasic.components.impl.Data
NucleusChuwaNoComponent"></bean>
```
