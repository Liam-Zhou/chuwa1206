## What is the @configuration and @bean?

@configuration: The @Configuration annotation is used to indicate that a class declares one or more @Bean methods and may be processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans at runtime.

@bean: The @Bean annotation is used to declare a method as a bean producer. The method annotated with @Bean is responsible for creating and returning an instance of a bean.

## How do you handle the exception in Spring?

1. You can create a class annotated with @ControllerAdvice to define global exception handling for all controllers or specific controllers. Within this class, you can use methods annotated with @ExceptionHandler to handle specific exceptions.

2. Implement the HandlerExceptionResolver interface to create a custom exception resolver. This allows you to handle exceptions globally by providing your own logic for exception resolution.

## How do you do the validations in Spring? And list some validation annotaitons you know.

@NotNull: Specifies that the annotated element must not be null.

@NotEmpty: Asserts that the annotated string, collection, map, or array is not null or empty.

@NotBlank: Asserts that the annotated string is not null and has at least one non-whitespace character.

@Min and @Max: Specify the minimum and maximum values for numeric fields.

@Size: Specifies the size or length constraints on a string, collection, map, or array.

@Email: Ensures that the annotated string is a valid email address.

@Pattern: Defines a regular expression pattern that the annotated string must match.

@Valid: Cascades the validation of the annotated object. This is often used to validate nested objects or collections.

## What is the actuator, list some endpoints it provides?

Spring Boot Actuator is a set of production-ready features that provides monitoring, management, and operational endpoints for your Spring Boot application. It's designed to help you understand and interact with your application in a production environment.

Health Endpoint (/actuator/health): Provides information about the health of the application. It indicates whether the application is up and running and can include additional details about the system's health.

Info Endpoint (/actuator/info): Displays arbitrary application information. You can customize this endpoint to expose details about your application, such as build version, description, or any custom information.

Metrics Endpoint (/actuator/metrics): Exposes a wide range of metrics about the application, including JVM metrics, memory usage, garbage collection statistics, and custom metrics if configured.

Environment Endpoint (/actuator/env): Provides information about the application's environment, including properties, configuration, and system properties.

Beans Endpoint (/actuator/beans): Displays a list of all Spring beans in the application, along with their dependencies.

Config Props Endpoint (/actuator/configprops): Lists all configuration properties used in the application, showing their sources and resolved values.

Mappings Endpoint (/actuator/mappings): Provides a list of all available mappings in the application, including details about each endpoint and their respective HTTP methods.

Shutdown Endpoint (/actuator/shutdown): Allows for a graceful shutdown of the application. This endpoint is disabled by default and needs to be enabled explicitly.

## What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Spring boot?

1. Spring: The Spring Framework is a comprehensive framework for Java development that provides a modular and reusable set of building blocks for developing enterprise applications. It covers a wide range of features, including dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, data access, transaction management, and more. Spring promotes the use of design patterns and best practices, making it a popular choice for building scalable and maintainable Java applications.

2. Spring Boot: Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring Framework that simplifies the process of building production-ready applications with Spring. It provides a convention-over-configuration approach, allowing developers to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications with minimal effort. 

## What is IOC and What is DI?

Inversion of Control(IoC): The core principle of Spring, IoC, facilitates loose coupling between components by allowing the Spring container to manage the instantiation and configuration of objects.

Dependency Injection(DI): Spring supports DI, where components receive their dependencies from an external source rather than creating them internally. This promotes decoupling and testability.

## What is @CompnonentScan?

The @ComponentScan annotation is used in Spring to specify the base packages for Spring to scan for components (such as beans, services, and controllers) when automatically configuring the Spring application context. 

## How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?

In XML configuration, you can use the <context:component-scan> element to specify the base package(s) for component scanning.

In annotation-based configuration, you can use the @ComponentScan annotation on a configuration class to define the base package.

## What is @SpringbootApplication?

@SpringBootApplication marks the class as the main class of a Spring Boot application.

## How many ways wo can define a bean?

1. Using XML configuration, you can define beans in an XML file.

2. Using annotations like @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller to automatically detect and register beans during component scanning.

3. Using a Java configuration class annotated with @Configuration and defining methods annotated with @Bean.

## What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean?

When you annotate a class with @Component, the default bean name is derived from the class name by converting the first letter to lowercase. (class)

When you use @Bean in a configuration class to define a bean, the default bean name is derived from the method name by using the method name as the bean name. (method)

## What is the difference between @component and @service, @repository?

@Component: The most generic stereotype annotation. It indicates that the class is a Spring component, and its instances can be autodetected and registered by Spring during component scanning.

@Service: Used to annotate classes that provide business services or business logic in a service layer. It is often used in the service layer of an application.

@Repository: Used to annotate classes that interact with a database or other data store. It indicates that the class is a repository component responsible for data access and storage.

## How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?

@Autowired: Used for automatic dependency injection. It can be applied to fields, methods, or constructors.

@Inject: It is a standard Java annotation used for dependency injection.

@Resource: Used for dependency injection by name. It allows you to inject a bean by specifying its name as a string.

@Value: Used to inject values from property files or configuration directly into fields.

@Qualifier: Used in conjunction with @Autowired or @Inject to specify the exact bean to be injected when there are multiple candidates of the same type.

@Lazy: Used to indicate that a dependency should be lazily initialized. It delays the creation of the bean until it is actually needed.

## Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans  in Spring)? Which way is better and why?

Constructor Injection: In constructor injection, dependencies are injected through the constructor of the class. This is the most preferred and recommended way of injecting dependencies in Spring.

Setter Injection: In setter injection, dependencies are injected through setter methods of the class. This approach is useful when you want to provide flexibility for changing dependencies at runtime.

Field Injection: In field injection, dependencies are injected directly into fields of the class. While this approach is concise, it is generally considered less preferable than constructor injection, as it can lead to issues with testing and maintainability.

## If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay

In Spring, if you have multiple beans of the same type and you want to specify one as the primary bean, you can use the @Primary annotation. 

If you want Spring to automatically pick one bean when there is no primary bean specified, you can use @Qualifier along with @Autowired or @Inject. The @Qualifier annotation allows you to specify the name or the ID of the bean to be injected.

## What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?

Both BeanFactory and ApplicationContext are core interfaces in the Spring Framework that manage and provide access to beans in a Spring application. 

Use BeanFactory when you want lazy initialization and you have resource constraints.

Use ApplicationContext when you need additional features like event handling, AOP, or internationalization. It is suitable for modern, feature-rich Spring applications.

## What is the Scope of a Bean? and list the examples for each scope.

Singleton Scope: In singleton scope, a single bean instance is created, and it is shared by all requests for that bean within the Spring container.

Prototype Scope: In prototype scope, a new bean instance is created for each request, ensuring that a new instance is provided for every request for the bean.

Request Scope: In request scope, a new bean instance is created for each HTTP request. It is typically used in a web application context.

Session Scope: In session scope, a new bean instance is created for each user session in a web application.

Global Session Scope: Similar to session scope, but used in a portlet context for beans that are shared across multiple portlets within a portal application.

Application Scope: In application scope, a single bean instance is created for the entire lifecycle of the web application. It has been deprecated in favor of using the singleton scope.

WebSocket Scope: In WebSocket scope, a new bean instance is created for each WebSocket session. It is used in Spring WebSocket applications.
