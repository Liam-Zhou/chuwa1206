1. annotation.md has been created.

2. Explain how the below annotaitons specify the table in database?

```
@Column(columnDefinition = "varchar(255) default 'John Snow'")
private String name;
@Column(name="STUDENT_NAME", length=50, nullable=false, unique=false)
private String studentName;
```

- `@Column(columnDefinition = "varchar(255) default 'John Snow'"):` This annotation specifies the mapping of the name field to a column in the database table. where `columnDefinition` specifies the SQL fragment that should be used when generating the DDL (Data Definition Language) for the column. In this case, it defines a varchar column with a length of 255 characters, and the default value is set to 'John Snow'.
- `@Column(name="STUDENT_NAME", length=50, nullable=false, unique=false):` This annotation also specifies the mapping of the studentName field to a column in the database table.

  **name:** Specifies the name of the column in the database. In this case, the column name is explicitly set to "STUDENT_NAME".

  **length:** Specifies the maximum length of the column data. It limits the studentName column to 50 characters.

  **nullable:** Specifies whether the column can accept null values. In this case, it is set to false, meaning the studentName column cannot be null.

  **unique:** Specifies whether the column values must be unique. In this case, it is set to false, meaning duplicate values are allowed in the studentName column.

3. What is the default column names of the table in database for @Column?

   The `@Column` annotation in JPA is the name of the field or property in the entity class to which it is applied. If no `name` attribute is explicitly provided in the @Column annotation, he default column name is derived from the name of the field or property.

4. What are the layers in springboot application? what is the role of each layer?

   - **Presentation Layer (Controller or Web Layer):** This layer is responsible for handling client **requests** and returning appropriate **responses**.
     It typically consists of controllers annotated with `@Controller` or `@RestController`.
     Controllers receive incoming requests, process them, interact with service layers to perform business logic, and return responses to clients.
   - **Service Layer:** The service layer contains the **business logic** of the application.
     It encapsulates application-specific logic and orchestrates interactions between different components of the system.
     Service classes are annotated with `@Service` to indicate their role in the application.
     They often contain methods that implement complex business rules, perform data validation, and coordinate data access operations.
   - **Repository:** This layer is responsible for interacting with the **database** or **external data sources**.
     It encapsulates data access logic and provides an abstraction over the underlying data storage mechanism.
     Repository interfaces extend Spring Data repositories or implement custom data access logic using Spring's JdbcTemplate, EntityManager, or other persistence technologies.
     Repositories are annotated with `@Repository`.
     The repository layer shields the rest of the application from the complexities of data access, such as SQL queries and database transactions.
   - **Model Layer:** The model layer contains the domain model classes that represent the business entities and data structures of the application.
     It encapsulates the core business concepts, rules, and behaviors.
     Domain objects are often annotated with JPA annotations (@Entity, @OneToMany, etc.) to define their persistence and relationships.

5. Describe the flow in all of the layers if an API is called by Postman.

   - **Presentation Layer (Controller):** Postman sends an **HTTP request** to the URL mapped to a specific endpoint in the **Spring Boot application**. The request is received by the appropriate controller method in the **presentation layer**. The controller method processes the request, extracts any necessary parameters or data from the request body or headers, and prepares the required inputs for the **service layer**.
   - **Service Layer:** The controller delegates the processing of the request to the appropriate service method. The service method contains the **business logic** necessary to fulfill the request. This layer may involve performing **data validation**, **business rule enforcement**, **calling other services**, or **interacting with the DAO (repository)** to fetch or update data.
   - **Repository Layer:** If the service method requires **data access**, it interacts with the repository layer to perform **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the underlying database. The repository layer abstracts away the details of database interaction, such as generating SQL queries, managing transactions, and handling exceptions.
   - **Model Layer:** The model objects representing the data entities may be involved in the business logic processing. These objects encapsulate the data and behavior associated with the application domain.

   - After the **business logic** is executed and data manipulation is completed, the **service layer** prepares the **response** to be sent back to the client. The response may include data retrieved from the database, computed values, error messages, or other relevant information. The **service layer** returns the response object to the **controller**. The **controller** converts the response object into an appropriate format (e.g., JSON, XML) and sets the HTTP response status code and headers. The response is sent back to Postman as an HTTP response.

6. What is the application.properties? do you know application.yml?

   - `application.properties` is a text file used to configure Spring Boot applications using key-value pairs.
     It is a plain text file typically located in the src/main/resources directory of the Spring Boot project.
     Configuration properties defined in application.properties are loaded by the Spring Environment during application startup.
   - `application.yml` is a YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) file used for configuration in Spring Boot applications.
     It offers a more human-readable and concise way to define configuration properties compared to application.properties.
     Like application.properties, application.yml is also located in the src/main/resources directory.

7. Create a Project, name it with mongo-blog, write a POST API for mongo-blog, change database to MongoDB.

   Project create in "repo/SpringMongoDBTest"
