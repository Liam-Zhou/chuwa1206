2. **Authentication** is the process of verifying who a user is.

3. **Authorization** is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to.

4. **Difference between Authentication and Authorization:**
    - Authentication verifies identity to grant access to the system.
    - Authorization determines what resources a user can access within the system.

5. **HTTP Session** is a server-side storage of information that is desired to persist throughout the user's interaction with a web application.

6. **Cookie** is a small piece of data stored on the client's computer by the web browser while browsing a website.

7. **Difference between Session and Cookie:**
    - Session data is stored server-side.
    - Cookies are stored client-side.

8. **Using Session and Cookie:**
   Sessions can use cookies to store a session identifier that maps to the server-side session storage.

9. **JWT (JSON Web Token):** A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

10. **Spring Security Filter:** A component in the Spring Security filter chain that handles authentication and authorization.

11. **How JWT Works:**
    It encodes JSON objects, which are securely transmitted as tokens between parties.

12. **Password Encoding:**
    Yes, an encoder like BCryptPasswordEncoder is often used to encode passwords.

13. **UserDetailService, AuthenticationProvider, AuthenticationManager, AuthenticationFilter:**
- UserDetailsService: Loads user-specific data.
- AuthenticationProvider: Authenticates a user.
- AuthenticationManager: Manages authentication providers.
- AuthenticationFilter: Intercepts authentication requests.

14. **Disadvantage of Session:**
    Scalability can be an issue with sessions. Use stateless authentication like JWT to overcome this.

15. **Get Value from application.properties:**
    Use `@Value` annotation or `Environment` class.

16. **Role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth):**
- `HttpSecurity` configures security concerns for HTTP requests.
- `AuthenticationManagerBuilder` configures user authentication.

17. **Spring Security Authentication and Authorization:**
    Handles confirming user identity and permissions within a Spring application.
