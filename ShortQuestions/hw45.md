#### 2.what is authentication?

Authentication: spring security tries to. validate that `who are you`, are you a user in this application.

#### 3.What is authorization

Authorization: you send a request to spring boot, spring security will check if you have the rights to be  authorized to do that.

#### 4.difference between authenticate and authorization

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity. It's about answering the question, "Who are you?"

Authorization is the process of granting the authenticated user or entity permission to access different levels of information and perform specific actions. It's about answering the question, "What are you allowed to do?"

#### 5.What is http session

It's a mechanism used by web server to store stateful information on the server side to maintain user's state.

When a user accesses a web application, the server creates a new session. This is often triggered by user actions like logging in.A unique session ID is generated and sent to the user's browser, typically as a cookie.

The client sends the session ID back to the server with each HTTP request. The server retrieves the corresponding session data stored on the server and handles the request based on this data.

After a period of inactivity or when the user logs out, the session is terminated, and the corresponding data is deleted.

#### 6.What is Cookie? 

A cookie is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser when they visit a website. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to the server with subsequent requests. Cookies are used to remember information about the user, allowing the web server to offer a tailored experience and maintain stateful information across multiple browser sessions.

#### 7.What is the difference between Session and Cookie?

Session is stored on the server, while Cookie is stored in the web browser. Session data will be retrieved by SessionId, which may be stored as a cookie in the web browser and sent to the server at each HTTP requests.

#### 8.How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application?

When the user login in, the application generates a session id and send back to the web browser as a cookie. The browser stored the sessionId, and send it back to the server at each subsequent Http request.When the server receives the sessionId, it will ue it to retrieve according session data, thus maintaining user state and offer a tailored experience.

#### 9.What is JWT?

Java web token, is a way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.and it is been digitally signed. 

JWT contains three parts: Header, payload, signature.

#### 10.What is the spring security filter?

Spring Security uses a chain of filters to apply various security measures. Each filter in the chain is responsible for a specific task.

- When a request comes to a Spring Security-enabled application, it passes through the filter chain.
- Each filter in the chain has a specific responsibility and acts only if the request matches its criteria.
- Filters intercept the request, perform their operations (like authentication checks), and then either pass the request to the next filter in the chain or block the request.

#### 11.decribe how do JWT work

1. user authentication (by credentials)
2. server generates a JWT

3. server sends JWT to the Client, Client stored

4. client uses JWT to request the server

5. if token expires, the client need to re-authenticate

#### 12.Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?

**BCryptPasswordEncoder**, **Argon2PasswordEncoder**

#### 14.What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?

in a traditional session management setup, session data is stored in the server's memory. This can become a problem in load-balanced environments where the application runs on multiple servers, as each server may have different session data.

**Centralized Session Store**: Use a centralized data store for all sessions, such as Redis or a relational database, accessible by all application instances.

#### 15.how to get value from application.properties?

username=abc

```java
@Value("${username}")

private String username;
```

```java
@Component
public class MyService {
    @Autowired
    private Environment env;

    public void someMethod() {
        String username = env.getProperty("username");
        // ...
    }
}
```

#### 17.What is Spring security authentication and authorization?

Authentication:

- A principal (user) presents their credentials (like username/password, tokens, etc.) to the application.
- Spring Security validates these credentials against the information stored in a database, LDAP, a third-party identity provider, or other data sources.
- Upon successful authentication, Spring Security creates an `Authentication` object representing the principal's identity and stores it in a `SecurityContext`.

Authorization:

- After a user is authenticated, authorization comes into play for every secured resource or operation.
- Spring Security checks the principal's authorities or roles against the permissions required to access the resource or perform the operation.
- This is often managed through annotations like `@PreAuthorize`, `@Secured`, or configuration patterns in the security configuration.
