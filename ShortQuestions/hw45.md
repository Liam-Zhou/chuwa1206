2. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or entity to grant access to a system or resource. It typically involves checking credentials like passwords, biometric data, or security tokens.

3. Authorization is the process of determining whether a user, program, or device has the right to access a specific resource or perform a particular action within a system, typically after successful authentication.

4. Authentication is verifying the identity of a user, while authorization is determining their access rights and permissions within a system. Authentication asks "Who are you?" and authorization asks "What are you allowed to do?"

5. An HTTP session is a way to store information across multiple HTTP requests for a particular user. It allows web applications to maintain user-specific data such as user preferences, authentication status, and other data needed for a consistent experience during a user's visit (or session) on a website. Since HTTP is stateless, sessions provide a method to retain state across requests.

6. A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the web browser while the user is browsing. Cookies are designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information (such as items in a shopping cart) or to record the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, logging in, or recording which pages were visited in the past). They can also be used to remember pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields, such as names, addresses, passwords, and credit card numbers.

8. To keep user information across an application using sessions and cookies:
   1. **Session Creation**: When a user logs in, the server creates a session with a unique session ID.
   2. **Storing Session ID in Cookie**: This session ID is sent to the client's browser and stored there as a cookie.
   3. **Client Requests**: With each subsequent request, the browser sends the cookie containing the session ID back to the server.
   4. **Server Retrieves Session**: The server reads the session ID from the cookie, finds the corresponding session in its storage, and retrieves the user's stored information.
   5. **Data Persistence**: User information is maintained across the application as long as the session is active and the cookie with the session ID is available.
9. JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It's typically used in authentication and information exchange, enabling the secure transmission of information as a JSON object, which can be verified and trusted due to its digital signature.

10. Spring Security Filter is a component in the Spring Security framework that intercepts HTTP requests to a web application for security purposes, such as authentication, authorization, and other security checks. It integrates with the standard servlet filter mechanism to apply these security measures.

11. JWT works as follows:

    1. **Creation**: A server generates a JWT by encoding user-specific data (claims) into a JSON object.
    2. **Signing**: The server signs the JWT with a secret key or a public/private key pair for verification.
    3. **Transmission**: The server sends the JWT to the client, typically after successful authentication.
    4. **Usage**: The client sends the JWT back to the server in HTTP requests, usually in the Authorization header.
    5. **Verification**: The server verifies the JWT's signature to ensure it's valid and hasn't been tampered with.
    6. **Extraction**: If the JWT is valid, the server extracts the user data from the token for authorization and other purposes.

12. In secure applications, passwords should always be encoded using a hash function. Commonly used encoders are bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2. These provide strong hashing with salting to protect against various types of attacks.

13. :

    1. **UserDetailsService**: It's a core interface in Spring Security that loads user-specific data. It is used by the `AuthenticationManager` to retrieve user information (like username, password, and authorities) during authentication.
    2. **AuthenticationProvider**: This interface defines the functionality for an authentication mechanism in Spring Security. It authenticates a given `Authentication` object and returns a fully populated `Authentication` instance if successful.
    3. **AuthenticationManager**: The central interface in Spring Security's authentication process. It declares a single method, `authenticate()`, which takes an `Authentication` instance and returns an authenticated `Authentication` instance if authentication is successful.
    4. **AuthenticationFilter**: It intercepts incoming requests and attempts to perform authentication based on the request data. Common examples include `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter` and `JwtAuthenticationFilter`. They extract credentials and other relevant information from the request and use the `AuthenticationManager` to perform the authentication process.

14. Disadvantage of Session: Sessions can be resource-intensive on the server side, as they require memory for each user. This can be problematic for applications with many users or in distributed environments.

    How to Overcome: This can be mitigated by implementing session storage that doesn't rely on server memory (like in a database or a distributed cache) and by using stateless authentication methods like JWTs for scalability in distributed environments.

    @Value("${property.name}")
    private String propertyValue;
    ```

16. **configure(HttpSecurity http)**: Defines which URL paths should be secured and how, by configuring web-based security for specific http requests. It allows setting up authorization, defining request patterns, and associating security constraints.

    **configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)**: Used to establish an authentication mechanism by allowing AuthenticationProviders to be added. It configures how the system finds out about users and their credentials (like in-memory authentication, database authentication, or LDAP).

17. **Authentication**: The process of verifying a user's identity, usually through credentials like username and password.

    **Authorization**: The process of determining if an authenticated user has permission to access a resource or perform an action.
