2. Authentication is to check if user or login info is valid.
3. Authorization is to check if the user is allowed to call the api or get resource.
4. One is to check identity, the other one is to check authority.
5. session is a server-side storage mechanism used to maintain state across multiple requests from the same user.
6. A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a web server to a user's browser. The browser stores the cookie and sends it back with each subsequent request to the same server.
7. Session is stored server side, cookie is stored client side
8. Server may assign a session id to the client and it will be stored as cookie on client side. In the subsequent requests, session id is sent with the request so that server can retrieve session based on session id.
9. JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the **HMAC** algorithm) or a public/private key pair using **RSA** or **ECDSA**.
10. The Spring Security filter contains a list of filter chains and dispatches a request to the first chain that matches it.
11. Client login with username and password. Server validates the info and generate the JWT using secret key and return it to client. In the subsequent requests, JWT is taken along so that server can validate jwt and get user info.
12. Bcrypt
13. .
14. Session needs to be stored and queried on server. So it's difficult for distributed system to share the same user's session. We can use some shares session techniques like Redis to manage the sessions globally.
15. @Value
16. The former one is to configure the filters, the latter one is to configure the authentication manager.
