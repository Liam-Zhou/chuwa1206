2. What is Authentication?
   Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It typically involves checking credentials like usernames and passwords, biometric data, or security tokens to confirm that an entity is who they claim to be.

3. What is Authorization?
   Authorization is the process of determining whether an authenticated user has permission to access a particular resource or perform a specific operation. It involves checking user roles, permissions, or policies to grant or deny access.

4. Difference Between Authentication and Authorization
   Authentication verifies who the user is.
   Authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do.
5. What is HTTP Session?
   An HTTP session is a server-side storage mechanism to store user-specific data across multiple HTTP requests. It's used to maintain state between client-server interactions in a stateless HTTP protocol.

6. What is a Cookie?
   A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser. Cookies are used to remember information about the user for the duration of a web session or for future visits.

7. Difference Between Session and Cookie
   Session is server-side storage, holding user data across requests. Each session is identified by a unique ID.
   Cookies are client-side, stored in the browser, and sent with HTTP requests. They can store session IDs or other user-specific info.
8. Using Session and Cookies
   Sessions and cookies are often used together: the session ID is stored in a cookie on the client-side and sent with each request, allowing the server to retrieve the corresponding session data.

9. What is JWT?
   JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It's often used for stateless authentication and information exchange.

10. Spring Security Filter
    Spring Security filters are part of the security filter chain in Spring Security, responsible for intercepting HTTP requests to enforce security measures like authentication and authorization.

11. How JWT Works
    JWT typically consists of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature. The Header specifies the token type and hashing algorithm, the Payload contains the claims (data), and the Signature is used to verify the token's integrity.

12. Encoding Passwords
    Yes, passwords should be encoded using a password encoder (like BCryptPasswordEncoder in Spring Security) for security purposes. This prevents storing plain-text passwords.

13. UserDetailsService, AuthenticationProvider, AuthenticationManager, AuthenticationFilter
    UserDetailsService: Interface for retrieving user-related data for authentication.
    AuthenticationProvider: Interface for processing an authentication request.
    AuthenticationManager: Interface for delegating authentication requests to various AuthenticationProviders.
    AuthenticationFilter: Filters in the security chain responsible for processing authentication requests, like UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.
14. Disadvantage of Session and Overcoming It
    Disadvantage: Sessions can consume significant server memory with high user loads, and they don't scale well in distributed applications.
    Solution: Use stateless authentication mechanisms like JWTs or store session data in a distributed cache or session store.
15. Accessing application.properties Values

    Use @Value annotation in Spring to inject values from application.properties:
    ```java
    @Value("${property.name}")
    private String propertyValue;
    ```
16. Role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)
    configure(HttpSecurity http): Configures web-based security for specific http requests.
    configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth): Configures the global user details for authentication.
17. Spring Security Authentication and Authorization
    Authentication: In Spring Security, it's the process of verifying user credentials (like username/password) to grant access.
    Authorization: It's about determining if the authenticated user has the right to access certain resources or perform operations.
