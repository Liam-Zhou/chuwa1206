### Q2
**Authentication** is a process of verifying a user's identity using methods like passwords, biometrics, and security tokens, aimed at protecting against unauthorized access and maintaining data security
### Q3
**Authorization** is a process of determining a user's permission to access resources or perform actions within a system, typically occurring after successful authentication
### Q4
Authentication is about verifying a user's identity, while authorization is about determining what an authenticated user is permitted to do w/in a system
### Q5
An **HTTP session** is a way to store data across multiple HTTP requests, allowing for the persistence of user-specific information (like login status or preferences) as they navigate a web application. It's maintained on the **server side** and typically identified by a **unique session ID**.
### Q6
A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by their web browser while browsing. Cookies are used to remember information about the user, such as login status or site preferences, for a more personalized web experience
### Q7
Main differences lie in storage location(server vs browser) and the primary uses(managing a session vs storing user data)
### Q8
- user logs in
  - user enters credentials
  - server authenticates the user
- create session
  - upon successful login, the server creates a session
  - a unique session ID is generated
- server retrieves session
  - with each request, the server reads the session ID from the cookie
  - the server accesses the corresponding session data
- maintain user data
  - user-specific data is stored in the session
  - the data is accessible across the application during the session
- session expiration
  - sessions expire after a set time or logout
  - the server deletes the session; the cookie becomes invalid
### Q9
JWT(JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred btwn two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is digitally signed and optionally encrypted
JWT are typically used for authentication and information exchange, providing a way to securely transmit data btwn system
they are widely used in web applications for user authentication and authorization
### Q10
Spring security filter is a component in the spring security framework for java, used to intercept HTTP requests in an application to enforce seccurity measures such as authentication and authorization, based on predefined rules and configurations
### Q11
- user sign-in
- authentication server verifies the credentials and issues a JWT signed using either a secret salt or a private key
- user's client uses the JWT to access protected resources by passing the JWT in HTTP authorization header
- resource server then verifies the authenticity of the token using the secret salt/public key
### Q12
Encode for password is a tool that converts plain text passwords into a secure, hashed format for safe storage, using algorithms like SHA-256 or bcrypt to prevent reverse-engineering and enhance security
### Q13
- `UserDetailService` is an interface in spring security used to retrieve user-related data. It loads user-specific data(username...) for authentication purposes
- `AuthenticationProvider` represents a mechanism to authenticate a user in spring security. It authenticates user credentials against a specific source(database)
- `AuthenticationManager` is the main strategy interface for authentication in spring security. It orchestrates the authentication process by delegating to a list of AuthenticationProviders
- `AuthenticationFilter` is a filter in the spring security filter chain responsible for processing authentication reequests, like capturing login credentials and passing them to the AuthenticationManager
### Q14
- scalability issue
  - traditional session management can strain server resources in high-traffic applications
    - implement distributed session management using technologies like Redis
- session hijacking
  - sessions are vulnerable to hijacking if the sessionID is intercepted
    - use secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite cookies; implement HTTPS to encrypt the sessionID
- server dependency
  - user session data is stored on the server, creating a dependency
    - adopt stateless authentication methods like JWTs, which store session data on the client side
- load balancing challenges
  - in a load-balanced environment, ensuring a user's requests are routed to the correct server holding their session can be complex
    - use sticky sessions or replicate session data across servers
### Q15
- define a property inside `application.properties`
- use `@Value` annotation
### Q16
- `configure(HttpSecurity http)` is the configures web-based security at a resource level
  - controls how requests are secured by interceptors
  - defines URL-based security restrictions
  - restricting access to certain URLs based on user roles
- `configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)` is configures user-specific data for authentication
  - set up the service to retrieve user information
  - specifies the password encoder
  - configuring a database authentication provider with a password encoder
### Q17
- `Authentication` verifies user identity using credentials. Implemented with `AuthenticationManager` `AuthenticationProvider` and `UserDetailsService`
- `Authorization` determines what authenticated users can do, controlling access to resources. Configured with role-based and expression-based access controls via `HttpSecurity`
