2.  What is the authentication?
    Authentication verifies the user's identity, ensuring that they are who they claim to be, typically through credentials like username and password.
3.  What is the authorization?
    Authorization determines what resources and operations a user can access after being authenticated.
4.  What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
    Authentication is about validating user credentials to confirm their identity, whereas authorization is about granting access to resources based on their identity.
5.  What is HTTP Session?
    An HTTP session is a server-side storage of information that is desired to persist across multiple requests from the same client.
6.  What is Cookie?
    A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser while the user is browsing.
7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
   A session stores data on the server side and uses a session ID stored in a cookie on the client side for identification, while a cookie directly stores data on the client side.
8.  How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the
    application? 
Sessions use cookies to store a session ID and maintain user state across requests, while cookies can store user preferences or login states directly on the client side.
9.  What is JWT?
    JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
10. What is the spring security filter?
    A Spring Security filter is part of the filter chain that carries out the authentication and authorization process in a Spring Security context.
11. decribe how do JWT work(slides 里有图， 26页)
    JWT works by encoding JSON data into a compact token format, which is signed and optionally encrypted. It's sent to the client and then returned to the server on each request to prove authentication.
12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
    Yes, passwords should be encoded using a strong hash function, such as bcrypt, to ensure security.
13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager?
    AuthenticationFilter?(把这几个名字看熟悉也行)
    UserDetailsService is a core interface in Spring Security that loads user-specific data.
    AuthenticationProvider is an interface that provides an authentication mechanism.
    AuthenticationManager is an interface for authenticating a user.
    AuthenticationFilter is a filter used to intercept authentication requests.
14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
    The main disadvantage of sessions is server memory consumption. To overcome this, you can use token-based authentication like JWTs which are stateless.
15. how to get value from application.properties?
    In Spring, you can use the @Value annotation or the Environment class to access values from application.properties.
16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and
    configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
    configure(HttpSecurity http) defines which URL paths should be secured and how.
    configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) is used to set up an authentication mechanism by allowing it to know where to find user details for authentication and password encoding.
17.  What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
     In Spring Security, authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of determining what they have access to.
