# 2. @Configuration and @Bean
1. `@Configuration`
Purpose: The `@Configuration` annotation in Spring Framework is used to indicate that a class declares one or more `@Bean` methods.
Usage: It's typically used in Spring-based applications for defining beans and dependency injection configurations. The @Configuration classes are part of the Spring container and are used to instantiate and configure beans.
2. `@Bean`
Purpose: The `@Bean` annotation is used at the **method level** and signals to the Spring container that a method produces a bean to be managed.
Usage: It's placed on methods within a @Configuration annotated class. The method's return type defines the bean type, and the method name is the default bean name.
```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean() {
        // Instantiate and configure MyBean
        return new MyBean();
    }
}
```

# 3. Exception Handling in Spring
Exception handling in Spring, especially for web applications, can be achieved using @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler annotations.

1. `@ControllerAdvice`: This annotation is used to define a **global exception handler** class that can handle exceptions across multiple controllers.
2. `@ExceptionHandler`: This method-level annotation is used within a class annotated with `@ControllerAdvice` to handle specific exceptions.
```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(CustomException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleCustomException(CustomException ex) {
        // Handle exception and return response
        return new ResponseEntity<>(ex.getMessage(), HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
    }
}
```

# 4. Validations in Spring
Validations in Spring can be implemented using the Java Bean Validation API (javax.validation) and annotations.

Usage: Place validation annotations on fields in your model classes(DTO). 
When a model object is passed to a controller method, you can use the @Valid or @Validated annotation to trigger validation.

Some Common Validation Annotations:
+ @NotNull: The annotated element must not be null.
+ @NotEmpty: The annotated element must not be empty. Applied to collections, strings, or arrays.
+ @Size(min = x, max = y): The annotated element size must be between the specified boundaries.
+ @Email: The annotated string must be a valid email address.
+ @Min(value): The annotated element must be a number greater than or equal to the specified value.
+ @Max(value): The annotated element must be a number less than or equal to the specified value.

# 5. Spring Boot Actuator and Its Endpoints
Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features to help you monitor and manage your application.

Common Actuator Endpoints:
+ health: Shows application health information.
+ info: Displays arbitrary application information.
+ metrics: Shows various metrics for the application.
+ env: Exposes properties from Spring's ConfigurableEnvironment.
+ loggers: Shows and modifies the configuration of loggers in the application.
+ threaddump: Performs a thread dump.
+ auditevents: Exposes audit events information.
+ httptrace: Displays HTTP trace information (by default, the last 100 HTTP request-response exchanges).
To enable these endpoints, you need to include the Spring Boot Actuator dependency in your project and configure the desired endpoints in your application properties or YAML file. 
Actuator endpoints can be exposed over JMX or HTTP, providing valuable insights into the runtime state of your application.
