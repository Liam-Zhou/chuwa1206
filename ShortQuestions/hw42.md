* List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
  - `Entity`: Marks a class as a JPA entity, representing a table in a database.
  - `@Table`:secifies the details of the database table to which the entity is mapped.
  - `id`: Marks a field as the primary key of the entity.
  - `@GeneratedValue`: Defines the strategy used to generate values for the primary key. Commonly used with GenerationType.IDENTITY or GenerationType.AUTO. 
  - `@Column`: Allows the customization of column mappings in the database table.
  - `@OneToMany`: Establishes a one-to-many relationship between two entities.
  - `@ManyToOne`: Establishes a many-to-one relationship between two entities. 
  - `@JoinColumn`: Specifies the mapping of the foreign key column in a relationship.
  - `@Repository`:Indicates that a class is a Spring Data repository, allowing it to be scanned and instantiated by Spring.
  - `@Query`: Defines a custom query using JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) or native SQL.

* jpa hibernate
 - `JPA`: which stands for Java Persistence API, is a specification for managing relational data in Java applications. 
 - `hibernate`: Hibernate is a popular and widely used implementation of the JPA specification. It is an open-source, object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for Java. 

* hikari
  HikariCP is a high-performance JDBC connection pool that is widely used in Java applications. It is known for its lightweight nature, low overhead, and efficient management of database connections.

* What is the  @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany? write some examples：
  - `@OneToMany`:
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "author")
    private List<Book> books;
  - `@ManyToOne`:
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
    private Department department;
  - `@ManyToMany`
    @ManyToMany
    @JoinTable(name = "student_course",
    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "student_id"),
    inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "course_id"))
    private List<Course> courses;
  
* cascade
-  the cascade attribute in an association mapping is used to specify the operations that should be cascaded to the target entity.
- `cascade = CascadeType.ALL`: It specifies that all operations (persist, merge, remove, refresh, and detach) should be cascaded to the target entity.
  CascadeType.PERSIST: Cascades the persist operation to the target entity, i.e., when the owning entity is persisted, the target entity is also persisted.
- `CascadeType.MERGE`: Cascades the merge operation to the target entity, i.e., when the owning entity is merged, the target entity is also merged.
- `CascadeType.REMOVE`: Cascades the remove operation to the target entity, i.e., when the owning entity is removed, the target entity is also removed.
- `CascadeType.REFRESH`: Cascades the refresh operation to the target entity, i.e., when the owning entity is refreshed, the target entity is also refreshed.
- `CascadeType.DETACH`: Cascades the detach operation to the target entity, i.e., when the owning entity is detached, the target entity is also detached.  

* What is the  fetch = FetchType.LAZY, fetch = FetchType.EAGER? what is the
  difference? In which situation you choose which one?
- `FetchType.LAZY`: the related entities are loaded lazily, meaning they are fetched from the database only when accessed for the first time
- `FetchType.EAGER`:the related entities are loaded eagerly, meaning they are fetched from the database immediately along with the owning entity. 

* What is the rule of JPA naming convention? Shall we implement the method by
  ourselves? Could you list some examples?
- JPA (Java Persistence API) follows certain naming conventions and rules for defining entity classes and their associated fields and methods. Adhering to these conventions helps 
maintain consistency and ensures that JPA can correctly interpret and map entities to database tables.

* jpql
- `JPQL`, or Java Persistence Query Language, is a query language defined as part of the Java Persistence API (JPA). It is a platform-independent object-oriented query language used to perform database operations on JPA entities.

* What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?
- `@NameQueries` annotation is used to define the multiple named queries. @NameQuery annotation is used to define the single named query.

* What is @Query? In which Interface we write the sql or JPQL?
- The JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) is an object-oriented query language which is used to perform database operations on persistent entities.

* hql
- HQL, or Hibernate Query Language, is a query language provided by Hibernate, which is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for Java. 

* What is EnityManager?
- `EntityManager` is an API that manages the lifecycle of entity instances. An EntityManager object manages a set of entities that are defined by a persistence unit.

* What is SessionFactory and Session?
  - `SessionFactory` is a thread safe object and used by all the threads of an application.
  - `Session` is used to get a physical connection with a database.

* What is Transaction? how to manage your transaction?
- A `Transaction` is a logical unit of processing in a DBMS which entails one or more database access operation. In a nutshell, database transactions represent real-world events of any enterprise.

* hibernate cache
- `Caching` is a mechanism to enhance the performance of a system. It is a buffer memorythat lies between the application and the database.

* cache
- The `first-level cache` is localized to a single session and helps to reduce database queries by caching retrieved data. 
- The `second-level cache` is shared across sessions and enables data to be cached across multiple requests.
