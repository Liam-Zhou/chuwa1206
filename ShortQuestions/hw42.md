4. What is JPA? and what is Hibernate?
   JPA (Java Persistence API): JPA is a Java specification for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects/classes and a relational database. JPA is an API for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), allowing developers to work with relational data in a more object-oriented way.
   Hibernate: Hibernate is an open-source ORM framework for Java applications. It's a concrete implementation of the JPA specification. Hibernate facilitates the mapping of Java class hierarchies to relational database tables and vice versa.
5.  What is Hiraki? what is the benefits of connection pool?

HikariCP: HikariCP is a high-performance JDBC connection pool. It's known for its lightweight, fast, and reliable nature.
Benefits of Connection Pooling: Connection pooling improves application performance by reducing the time taken to establish connections to the database. It maintains a pool of connections that can be reused for future requests, thus minimizing the overhead of opening and closing connections.
6.  What is the  @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany? write some examples.
    @OneToMany: Defines a one-to-many relationship between two entities. Example: A User entity can have multiple Order entities.
    @ManyToOne: Defines a many-to-one relationship between two entities. Example: Many Order entities can be linked to one User entity.
    @ManyToMany: Defines a many-to-many relationship between two entities. Example: A Student entity can have many Course entities and vice versa.
7. What is the  cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true? and what
   are the other CascadeType and their features? In which situation we choose
   which one?
   cascade = CascadeType.ALL: Indicates that all operations (PERSIST, REMOVE, REFRESH, MERGE, DETACH) applied on a parent entity must be cascaded to the associated child entity.
   orphanRemoval = true: If an entity is removed from the relationship, it will be automatically deleted if orphanRemoval is set to true.
   Other Cascade Types: PERSIST (save operations are cascaded), MERGE (merge operations are cascaded), REMOVE (delete operations are cascaded), REFRESH (refresh operations are cascaded), DETACH (entity is detached from the persistence context).
   Choosing CascadeType: The choice of cascade type depends on the domain model and how the entities are related. For instance, CascadeType.ALL is used when the child entity should always follow the state transitions of the parent entity.
8.  What is the  fetch = FetchType.LAZY, fetch = FetchType.EAGER? what is the
    difference? In which situation you choose which one?
    FetchType.LAZY: Indicates that the association is fetched lazily, i.e., the data is fetched on-demand.
    FetchType.EAGER: Indicates that the association should be fetched eagerly, i.e., the data is fetched immediately.
    Choosing Fetch Type: LAZY is chosen for better performance and when the related entities are not immediately required. EAGER is chosen when the related entities are frequently accessed and needed immediately with the parent entity.
9.  What is the rule of JPA naming convention? Shall we implement the method by
    ourselves? Could you list some examples?
    JPA repositories can use method names to automatically generate SQL queries. The naming convention follows property names of the entity class. For example, findByName(String name) would generate a query to find entities by the name property. Custom methods can also be implemented if necessary, but often JPA's method naming conventions and query derivation capabilities are sufficient for many use cases.

13. What is JPQL?
    PQL is a query language provided by JPA used to make queries against entities stored in a relational database. JPQL is similar to SQL but operates on the entity model rather than the database tables.
14. What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?
    @NamedQuery: This annotation is used to specify a static named query at the entity level. A named query is a JPQL query that is statically defined and linked with a name, allowing it to be called elsewhere in the application by this name.
    @NamedQueries: This annotation is used to define multiple @NamedQuery annotations. It's a container for specifying several named queries, not just one.
15. What is @Query? In which Interface we write the sql or JPQL?
    The @Query annotation is used to specify a custom query (SQL or JPQL) directly on repository methods in the Spring Data repository interface. This allows for flexibility beyond the standard query derivation from method names.
16. What is HQL and Criteria Queries?
    HQL (Hibernate Query Language): HQL is very similar to JPQL and is specific to Hibernate. It allows you to perform queries against your database using the class and property names of your Hibernate entities rather than the actual table and column names.
    Criteria Queries: This is a programmatic, type-safe way to construct queries in Hibernate. It's useful for building complex queries dynamically, where the specifics of the query are not known until runtime.
17.  What is EnityManager?
     The EntityManager interface is part of JPA and is used to manage the persistence of entities. It provides methods for creating, finding, and removing entities, and it manages the context of persistence including transactions.
18. What is SessionFactory and Session?
    SessionFactory: In Hibernate, the SessionFactory is a thread-safe, immutable cache of compiled mappings for a single database. It's used to create Session instances.
    Session: A Session is a single-threaded, short-lived object concept in Hibernate. It represents a single unit of work with the database, wrapping a JDBC connection and is used to perform CRUD operations on entities.
19. What is Transaction? how to manage your transaction?
    A transaction in the context of database operations is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. Transactions ensure data integrity and consistency. In Hibernate and Spring, transactions can be managed declaratively using @Transactional annotations or programmatically using transaction management APIs.
20. What is hibernate Caching?
    Hibernate caching is a mechanism to reduce the number of database accesses by storing entities or query results in memory. It improves application performance by minimizing the costly database operations.
21. What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?
    First-level Cache: This is associated with the Session object in Hibernate and is enabled by default. It ensures that each entity instance is loaded only once in the persistent context.
    Second-level Cache: This is associated with the SessionFactory object and is optional. It's shared across sessions and can cache data across transactions, sessions, and even applications, depending on the configuration.
22. How do you understand @Transactional? (https://github.com/TAIsRich/tutorial-
    transaction)
    The @Transactional annotation in Spring specifies that a method or class should be executed within a transactional context. It abstracts away the boilerplate code related to transaction management. When a method annotated with @Transactional is executed, Spring ensures that it runs within a transaction. If the method completes successfully, the transaction is committed. If an exception is thrown, the transaction is rolled back, maintaining data integrity.
