Annotation	Usage
@SpringBootApplication	the main class of a SpringBoot application, ensure auto-configuration

@Controller	marks a class as Spring MVC controller, handles http requests and returns responses

@RestController	specialized version of @Controller, indicates the return values from methods should be directly serialized to HTTP response body

@Service	used to contain business logic, as service component in the business layer

@Repository	used to perform database operation using Springdata JPA

@Autowired	injects a dependency automatically by Spring, on field, setter, constructor

@RequestMapping	map http requests to handler method in controller, define URI, http method for particular request

@PathVariable	extracts values from the URI path and injects them into controller method

@RequestBody	binds the http request body to a method parameter, used for handling JSON data in request body

@RequestParam	bind request params to method params, used to extract query param for the URL

@Entity	mark a class as JPA entity, represents table in database

@Id	marks a field as the primary key of a JPA entity

@GeneratedValue	configures the strategy for generating primary key values in JPA entity

@OneToMany``@ManyToOne	define ono-to-many, many-to-one relationships btwn JPA entities

@JoinColumn	specifies the join column for an association

@Transactional	can mark a method, class, ensures that it is executed within a transaction

@Component	can mark a class, used for auto-detection, auto-wiring

@Configuration	a class declares one or more @Bean method,used in conjunction with @Bean to define beans for the app context

@Bean	indicates a method produces a bean to be managed by Spring container

@Value	injects values from properties files or environment variables into fields or methods

### 4
- JPA uses JDBC to CRUD database, and also transfer result from database to Java Entities
- Hibernate is an Object Relational Mapping tool(ORM), that map the database tables and vice-versa
### 5
- Hikari is a JDBC DataSource implementation that provides a connection pooling mechanism.
- improved application performance, resource optimization, and seamless scalability
### 6
- `@OneToMany`
  - one entity has a collection of another entity
  - author-book
- `@ManyToOne`
  - many entities of one type are associated with a single entity of another type
  - book-author
- `@ManyToMany`
  - many entities of both types are associated with each other
  - student-course
### 7
- It attributes specifies that all operations should be cascaded to the associated entities, and when set `orphanRemoval` to true indicates that orphaned child entities should be removed from the database
  - `CascadeType.PERSIST`
  - `CascadeType.MERGE`
  - `CascadeType.REMOVE`
  - `CascadeType.REFRESH`
- consider the business logic(any requirements), performance(`CascadeType.ALL`), and data integrity(ensure cascading operations align with the data integrity requirements)
### 8
- `FetchType.LAZY` means they are fetched from the database only when the associated property is accessed for the first time. It helps improve performance by avoiding unnecessary loading of associated entities until they are actually needed
- `FetchType.EAGER` is loaded eagerly along with the owning entity, regardless of whether they are needed or not. It can lead to the retrieval of more data than necessary, but ensures all associated entities are available immediately
- usage
  - large associations, lazy improves performance, vice-versa
  - for default behavior, `@ManyToOne`, `@OneToOne` is EAGER, `OneToMany` and `ManyToMany` is lazy
  - n+1 query problem, eager loading helps to avoid
### 9
- entity class name, should be in camel case and singular
  - `Author`, `Post`
- table, by default, is same as the entity name, however, we can customize using `@Table`
  - `@Table(name = "post")`
- primary key, should be named in compatible type(`Long`, `Integer`)
  - `private Long id`
- column, by default is same as the attribute name, also can customize by using `@Column`
  - `@Column(name = "content")`
- relationship method, should be named according to the role they play in the relationship
  - `getBooks()`
- query method, it provides a convenient way to define queries based on method names
  - `findByTitle`
- repository interface, after the entity they handle, followed by `Repository`
  - `PostRepository`
- NamedQuery, should be defined in the entity class and have unique names
  - `@NamedQuery(name = "Author.findAll", query = "SELECT a FROM Author a)`
### 10
### 11
### 12
### 13
it's query language used in JPA for querying relational database by using entity objects. similar to SQL, but operates on Java objects and their relationships, rather than on database tables
### 14
- `NamedQuery` is used to define a single named query w/in an entity class. it can be referenced by name in the EntityManager or through the entity manager's crateNamedQuery method
  - `@NamedQuery(name = "Book.findByTitle", query = "SELECT b FROM Book b WHERE b.title = :title)`
- `NamedQueries` is used to define multiple name queries w/in an entity class. to single one, providing a convenient way to organize and manage multiple named queries
  - `@NamedQueries({
    @NamedQuery(name = "Book.findByTitle", query = "SELECT b FROM Book b WHERE b.title = :title"),
    @NamedQuery(name = "Book.findByAuthor", query = "SELECT b FROM Book b WHERE b.author = :author")
    })`
### 15
- it's an annotation used to declare queries directly on repository methods
- JpaRepository interface
### 16
- they are two different approaches for querying databased in context of Hibernate, and ORM framework for Java
- hql is similar to SQL but operates on persistent objects rather than database tables
- criteria queries instead of writing queries as strings, it uses set of Java API classes to construct queries dynamically
### 17
it is a core interface in JPA, used for managing entities in persistence contest
### 18
- they both are concepts used in Hibernate
- `SessionFactory`, it's a heavyweight object that is typically created one during the application startup. It's thread-safe and used to created `Session` instances for different threads
- `Session` is short-lived object that represents a single-unit-of-work and acts as a gateway to the database, perform database operations. It's not thread-safe, and new `Session` should be obtained for each unit of work
### 19
- it is a unit of work that consists of a sequence of one or more operations, usually database operations, that need to be executed as a single unit.
- atomicity, they are atomic, if any operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back
- consistency, it brings the database from one consistent state to another
- isolation, they are isolated from each other, meaning that the intermediate states of one transaction are not visible to other transactions until the transaction is committed
- durability, once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and survive subsequent failures
### 20
it is a mechanism employed by the hibernate ORM framework to improve the performance of database operations by reducing the number of times data needs to be fetched from database.
caching involves storing the results of expensive database queries or operations in memory so that subsequent requests for the same data can be satisfied more quickly
### 21
the first-level cache is specific to single Hibernate session and is primarily concerned with caching entities for duration of that session
the second-level cache, is a global cache that can be shared across sessions and provides a broader caching scope, making it suitable for scenarios where data needs to be shared and reused across multiple session
### 22
it is used in Spring to define the scope of a single database transaction. It is applied to methods, classes, or interfaces to specify that a particular method, or all methods within a class or interface, should run within a transactional context.
