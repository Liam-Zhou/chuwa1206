2. Microservice Architecture Components/Tools/Dependencies
   1. Components: Services, API Gateway, Centralized Configuration, Service Registry and Discovery, Circuit Breakers.
   2. Tools: Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, Spring Boot for developing microservices, Consul/Eureka for service discovery, Zuul/Spring Cloud Gateway for API gateway, Hystrix for circuit breaking, Config Server for centralized configuration.
   3. Dependencies: Typically include frameworks and libraries like Spring Cloud, Netflix OSS, security libraries (OAuth, JWT), and client-side load balancing tools like Ribbon.
3. Resilience Patterns & Circuit Breaker
   Resilience Patterns: Design patterns that improve the resilience and fault tolerance of a system, such as retries, timeouts, circuit breakers, bulkheads, and fallbacks.
   Circuit Breaker: A pattern used to prevent a system from making calls to a service or performing an operation that's likely to fail. It "breaks" the circuit for failing calls to allow the system to continue operating without waiting for timeouts.
   How to Do Service Discovery
   Service discovery is implemented using tools like Eureka, Consul, or Zookeeper. Services register with the discovery server, and clients query the discovery server to find the available instances of services.

7. Major Components of Kafka
   + Broker: A Kafka server that stores data and serves clients.
   + Zookeeper: Manages broker cluster coordination and configuration.
   + Producer: Sends records to topics.
   + Consumer: Reads records from topics.
   + Topic: A category to which records are sent by producers.
   + Partition: Splits topics for scalability and parallelism.
8. Partition in Kafka
   A partition is a unit of parallelism in Kafka topics, where each partition can be placed on a different server, allowing for data to be written and read in parallel.

9. Zookeeper in Kafka and Its Uses
   Zookeeper manages and coordinates Kafka brokers. It's used for leader election among broker partitions, cluster membership, and metadata storage.

10. Kafka Without Zookeeper
    Kafka versions prior to 2.8 required Zookeeper for broker coordination. As of Kafka 2.8, there's KIP-500, which aims to remove the Zookeeper dependency for a self-managed metadata quorum, but transition is gradual.

11. Leader and Follower in Kafka
    Each partition has one leader broker and zero or more follower brokers. The leader handles all read/write requests for the partition, while followers replicate the leader's log.

12. Topic Replication & ISR in Kafka
    Replication ensures data availability and durability. ISR (In-Sync Replicas) is the set of broker replicas that are in sync with the leader and can be considered for leader election if the current leader fails.

13. Consumer Group in Kafka
    A consumer group is a set of consumers that work together to consume data from one or more topics. Each consumer within a group reads from exclusive partitions, ensuring efficient data processing.

14. Starting a Kafka Server
    
    `bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties`
    This command starts a Kafka broker using the default or specified configuration file.

15. Real-world Usages of Apache Kafka
    Kafka is used for event streaming, log aggregation, real-time analytics, data integration, and building reactive architectures.

16. Partitioning Key in Kafka
    A partitioning key is a key used by producers when sending messages to ensure that messages with the same key always go to the same partition for order preservation.

17. Purpose of Partitions in Kafka
    Partitions increase the scalability and throughput of Kafka topics by allowing data to be parallelized and distributed across multiple nodes.

18. RabbitMQ vs Kafka
    RabbitMQ is more message-oriented (suitable for traditional message queuing), while Kafka is designed for high-throughput, persistent, and scalable event streaming. Kafka supports larger data volumes and is optimized for streaming data processing.

19. Guarantees That Kafka Provides
    Kafka guarantees message ordering within a partition, at-least-once delivery, and durability through replication.

20. Unbalanced Cluster in Kafka & Balancing
    An unbalanced cluster occurs when some brokers have significantly more partitions than others. Rebalancing can be achieved using tools like LinkedIn's Cruise Control or manual partition reassignment.
