## 2. Document the microservice architeture and components/tools/dependencies
Documenting a microservice architecture involves detailing each service, its purpose, interfaces, and interactions with other services. Essential components include:

-Services: Each microservice's functionality, APIs, and endpoints.
-Databases: Data storage solutions, whether SQL, NoSQL, or others, used by each service.
-Messaging Systems: Tools like Kafka or RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication.
-API Gateways: Entry points for client requests, routing them to appropriate services.
-Load Balancers: Components for distributing network or application traffic across multiple services.
-Service Mesh: Infrastructure layer like Istio or Linkerd for service-to-service communication.
-Monitoring Tools: Systems like Prometheus or ELK stack for monitoring services.
-Tracing and Logging: Tools like Zipkin or Jaeger for distributed tracing, and centralized logging solutions.
-CI/CD Pipelines: Automated deployment pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
-Security: Authentication and authorization mechanisms, often with OAuth or JWT.
-Dependencies: Libraries and frameworks used within services, often documented in build files or dependency management tools.


## 3. What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?
Resilience patterns in microservices are design strategies to handle failures and ensure the system remains functional.

Circuit Breaker: It's a pattern that prevents a network or service failure from cascading to other services. Similar to an electrical circuit breaker, it "trips" and stops the flow of calls to a service that's failing, then periodically attempts to re-establish the connection and resume operations.

###Name three common tools mostly used for microservices.

Wiremock: For simulating HTTP-based APIs for testing.
Docker: For containerizing services.
Hystrix: For latency and fault tolerance.

###Write the difference between Monolithic, SOA, and Microservices Architecture.

Monolithic Architecture: A single-tiered software where all components are interconnected and interdependent.
SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture): Consists of services that communicate with each other, more loosely coupled than monolithic but still interconnected.
Microservices Architecture: Applications are composed of small, autonomous services with specific business goals, communicating over well-defined APIs.
Explain spring cloud and spring boot.

Spring Cloud: Tools and libraries to support building distributed systems and microservices, like configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, etc.
Spring Boot: A framework for building stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications quickly and with minimal configuration.

###What is the role of actuator in spring boot?
The actuator provides production-ready features like monitoring and managing the application through HTTP endpoints or with JMX.

###Explain how you can override the default properties of Spring boot projects.
Override default properties by specifying them in the application.properties or application.yml file.

###What issues are generally solved by spring clouds?
Issues like network problems, service discovery, redundancy, load balancing, and performance overhead in distributed systems.

###What do you mean by Cohesion and Coupling?

Coupling: The degree of interdependence between software modules.
Cohesion: The degree to which elements of a module belong together and serve a single well-defined task.

###What do you mean by Bounded Context?
Bounded Context is a DDD concept that defines the limits of a specific domain model and its consistency boundaries.

###Write the fundamental characteristics of Microservice Design.

Focused on business capabilities.
Products, not projects.
Essential messaging frameworks.
Decentralized governance and data management.
Automated and independent deployment.
Designed for failure and resilience.

###What are the challenges that one has to face while using Microservices?
Functional challenges include infrastructure complexity, investment, and planning. Technical challenges include inter-service communication, distributed system complexity, and configuration management.

###Explain PACT in microservices.
PACT is a tool for testing microservice interactions against a contract, ensuring the services can communicate as defined by the agreement.
## 5.how to do load balance in microservice? Write a long Summary by yourself.a. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/load-balancer-system-design-interview-question/b. https://www.fullstack.cafe/blog/load-balancing-interview-questions

In microservices, load balancing is the process of distributing network traffic and requests across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed, thereby increasing reliability and performance. This is achieved through a load balancer, which acts as a traffic manager directing client requests to the least busy servers based on predefined rules and checks.

There are several types of load balancers, including software load balancers that can reside on the client side or within the service infrastructure, and hardware load balancers that use physical devices to manage traffic.

Load balancers operate on different layers, such as Layer 4 (transport layer, using IP addresses and ports) and Layer 7 (application layer, using more complex data from the requests). Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) is also used for traffic distribution across geographically dispersed data centers.

To ensure efficient load distribution, various algorithms are employed, such as Round Robin, Weighted Round Robin, Least Connections, Least Response Time, and Source IP Hash.

In summary, implementing load balancing in a microservices architecture involves selecting the appropriate type of load balancer, placing it correctly within the system, and choosing an algorithm that best suits the application's needs. This ensures that the microservices can handle high volumes of requests and maintain high availability and performance.

## 6. How to do service discovery?
Service discovery is the automatic detection of devices and services offered by these devices on a computer network. In microservices, it helps services find and communicate with each other.

Manual: Statically configure service instances in configuration files.
DNS-Based: Services register their location in a DNS server, which can be queried to route traffic.
Service Registry: Services register themselves with a registry like Eureka or Consul, which other services query to find instances.

###a. Kafka Interview Questions for Freshers
Apache Kafka is an open-source streaming platform initially developed at LinkedIn. It's capable of handling high volumes of data and is used for fault-tolerant storage, as well as publishing and subscribing to streams of records. Kafka is scalable, meaning more nodes can be added to a Kafka cluster to increase capacity.
###b. Kafka Interview Questions for Experienced
Experienced individuals may face questions about Kafka's advanced features such as topic replication, the role of Zookeeper, and the concepts of Leader and Follower within Kafka. They might also be asked about scenarios where Kafka is not suitable, such as when only a small number of messages need to be processed or for long-term data storage.
###c. MCQ on Kafka
Multiple-choice questions on Kafka may cover its core architecture, components like topics and partitions, and Kafka's performance optimization, comparing it with other message queue systems like RabbitMQ, or understanding its usage in real-world scenarios.
