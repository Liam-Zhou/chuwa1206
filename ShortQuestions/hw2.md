2. Wrapper Class Concept

Wrapper classes provide the mechanism to transform primitives into objects and vice versa. The creation of a wrapper class automatically generates a new field for storing primitive data types.

3. HashMap Versus Hashtable

HashMap is non-synchronized and not thread-safe, whereas Hashtable is synchronized and thread-safe.

4. Concept of String Pool

The String Pool is a storage area in Java's Heap memory designated for string literals. It allows for the reuse of string constants, reducing memory consumption.

5. Java's Garbage Collection Mechanism

Java's garbage collection is an automated process that eliminates code that is no longer in use, thereby freeing up memory space automatically.

6. Java Access Modifiers

Access modifiers in Java determine the accessibility of classes, constructors, methods, and other components. They define the scope and visibility of these elements within a program:
   - public: permits full access across different classes
   - protected: permits access within the same package and its subclasses
   - private: restricts access to the defining class
   - default: permits access within the same package

7. Usage of 'final' Keyword

The 'final' keyword is a non-access modifier for classes, attributes, and methods, making them immutable and non-overridable.

8. Static Keyword

The 'static' keyword in Java is used for class-level variables and methods, accessible without creating a class instance. They are shared across all instances of the class and aid in efficient memory management.

9. Overriding vs Overloading

Overriding occurs when a child class redefines a method with the same signature as its superclass. Overloading happens when methods in the same class share the same name but have different parameters. Overloading is determined at compile time, whereas overriding occurs at runtime.

10. 'super' vs 'this' Keywords

   - super: references the immediate parent class object.
   - this: refers to the current class object.

11. Java's Loading Sequence

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) loading sequence begins with static variables and blocks, followed by constructors.

12. Concept of Polymorphism

Polymorphism in Java allows classes in a hierarchy to use inherited properties for diverse functions. It is implemented in two ways:
   - Overriding: occurs at runtime.
   - Overloading: occurs at compile time.

13. Encapsulation in Java

Encapsulation integrates data and code into a single unit, using access modifiers with classes, methods, and variables. It promotes data hiding and organizes related components, enhancing code clarity.

14. Abstract Classes vs Interfaces

   - Abstract Class: Contains the 'abstract' keyword in its declaration and a class can extend only one abstract class.
   - Interface: Serves as a blueprint for classes and can include non-fully implemented methods. A class can implement multiple interfaces.

15. Implementation of Queue Interface

   - PriorityQueue: A queue that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) rule.
   - LinkedList: A linear structure where elements are interconnected via pointers.
   - PriorityBlockingQueue: A thread-safe variant of PriorityQueue and LinkedList.
