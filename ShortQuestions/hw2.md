## 1.  Write up Example code to demonstrate the three foundmental concepts of OOP. 
1. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is a process of Binding data and methods within a class. Think of it like showing the essential details of a class by using the access control modifiers (public, private, protected
 ).

To achieve encapsulation in Java:
	- Declare the variables of a class as private.
	- Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variable values.

```
public class Employee {

    private String name;
    private int age;
    private double salary;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age > 0) {
            this.age = age;
        }
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    public void setSalary(double salary) {
        if (salary > 0) {
            this.salary = salary;
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp = new Employee();

        // Setting values through setter methods
        emp.setName("John Doe");
        emp.setAge(30);
        emp.setSalary(50000.0);

        // Accessing values through getter methods
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + emp.getName());
        System.out.println("Employee Age: " + emp.getAge());
        System.out.println("Employee Salary: " + emp.getSalary());
    }
}

```


2. Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the process in which an object or function takes different forms. There are 2 types of Polymorphism :

- Compile Time (static) Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
```
public class MathOperations {

    public int sum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public int sum(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}
```


- Run Time (dynamic) Polymorphism (Method Overriding)
```
class Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a shape");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape myShape = new Shape();     
        Shape myCircle = new Circle();   
        Shape myRectangle = new Rectangle();

        myShape.draw();       // Output: Drawing a shape
        myCircle.draw();      // Output: Drawing a circle (method overriding)
        myRectangle.draw();   // Output: Drawing a rectangle (method overriding)
    }
}
```

3. Inheritance
Inheritance provides a way to create a new class from an existing class. The new class is a specialized version of the existing class such that it inherits all the non-private fields (variables) and methods of the existing class. 

- Single Inheritance
```
class Bicycle {
    public int gear;
    public int speed;

    public Bicycle(int gear, int speed) {
        this.gear = gear;
        this.speed = speed;
    }

    public void speedUp(int increment) {
        speed += increment;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return ("Num of gears are " + gear + "\nSpeed of bicycle is " + speed);
    } 
}

class MountainBike extends Bicycle {

    public int seatHeight;

    public MountainBike(int gear, int speed, int startHeight) {
        // Invoking base-class constructor
        super(gear, speed);
        this.seatHeight = startHeight;
    } 

    public void setHeight(int newValue) {
        this.seatHeight = newValue;
    } 

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return (super.toString() + "\nSeat height is " + seatHeight);
    }
}

```

- Multiple Inheritance (using interfaces)
```
public interface Flyer {
    void fly();
}

public interface Swimmer {
    void swim();
}

public class FlyingFish implements Flyer, Swimmer {

    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("FlyingFish is flying");
    }

    @Override
    public void swim() {
        System.out.println("FlyingFish is swimming");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FlyingFish myFlyingFish = new FlyingFish();

        myFlyingFish.fly();   // Output: FlyingFish is flying
        myFlyingFish.swim();  // Output: FlyingFish is swimming
    }
}
```


## 2.  What is wrapper class in Java and Why we need wrapper class?
Wrapper classes in Java provide a way to use primitive data types (int, char, float, etc.) as objects. Each primitive data type in Java has a corresponding wrapper class:

- int ➔ Integer
- char ➔ Character
- byte ➔ Byte
- short ➔ Short
- long ➔ Long
- float ➔ Float
- double ➔ Double
- boolean ➔ Boolean

We need wrapper class for multiple reasons:
1. Use in Collections: Java collections such as ArrayList, HashMap, etc., can only hold objects and cannot store primitive types. 
2. Use of Object Methods: Wrapper classes provide a way to use methods and properties of objects. For example, the Integer class has methods like `.compareTo()`, `.toString()`, `.equals()`, and others.
3. Null Assignment: Primitives cannot be null, but their wrapper class objects can be. This is useful in scenarios where you may need to represent the absence of a value (e.g., in a database).
4. Type Safety: Wrapper classes help in enforcing type safety in generic code.
5. Class-Level Operations: Since primitives are not objects, operations like serialization, synchronization, etc., require the use of object counterparts.
