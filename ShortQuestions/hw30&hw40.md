- @Entity Usage: Specifies the primary key of an entity.
-  @GeneratedValue:Usage: Configures the way primary keys are generated.
- @Column:Usage: Defines the details of a database column.
- @RestController:Usage: Combines @Controller and @ResponseBody, indicating that the class is a RESTful controller.

* Entity
- `columnDefinition`: Specifies the SQL definition for the column. In this case, it defines a VARCHAR column with a maximum length of 255 characters and a default value of 'John Snow'.
- `name`: Specifies the name of the database column. In this case, the field studentName will be mapped to a column named "STUDENT_NAME".
- `length`: Specifies the maximum length of the column. Here, the maximum allowed length is 50 characters.
- `nullable`: Indicates whether the column can have a null value (false means not nullable).
- `unique`: Specifies whether the values in the column must be unique across all rows in the table (false means not unique).

* Column Name
- `firstName` and `operatingSystem`

* Layer and Roles
- `Presentation Layer` (Controller):
  Role: Handles user interactions, processes user input, and coordinates the overall flow of control. It receives requests from the client, invokes appropriate business logic, and returns responses to the client.
-  `Business Layer`
   Role: Contains the business logic and acts as an intermediary between the presentation layer and the data access layer. It performs specific operations required by the application and coordinates the application's functionality.
- `Persistence Layr`(Repository or DAO):
  Role: Manages the interaction with the database or any other persistent storage mechanism. It abstracts the details of data access, providing a clean and standardized interface for the service layer.
- `Database`


* Application Properties
- In a Spring Boot application, the application.properties (or application.yml) file is a central configuration file used to specify configuration properties for the application. These properties can control various aspects of the application's behavior, including database connection details, server settings, logging configuration, and more.
