1. **What is Selenium?** Selenium is a popular open-source web automation tool used for testing web applications. It allows testers and developers to write test scripts in various programming languages to automate browser actions, such as clicking links, filling out forms, and validating text, to test the functionality and performance of web applications across different browsers and platforms.

2. **What is Cucumber?** Cucumber is a software tool used for testing other software. It runs automated acceptance tests written in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style. At its core, Cucumber reads executable specifications written in plain language and validates that the software does what those specifications say. The language in which these specifications are written is called Gherkin.

3. **What is JMeter?** Apache JMeter is an open-source, Java-based load testing tool used to analyze and measure the performance of web applications, or different services. It is primarily used for performance testing but also supports other test functions, such as functional, load, and stress testing of web servers, networks, and other services.

4. **What is the lifecycle of JUnit?** The lifecycle of a JUnit test includes the following phases:

   - **@BeforeClass**: Runs once before any of the test methods in the class. It is used for static initializations.
   - **@BeforeEach**: Executes before each test method in the class.
   - **Test Method**: The actual test methods annotated with `@Test`.
   - **@AfterEach**: Executes after each test method in the class.
   - **@AfterClass**: Runs once after all the test methods in the class have been executed. It is used for clean-up activities.

5. **Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level (static)?** Yes, the `@BeforeAll` method in JUnit 5 (equivalent to `@BeforeClass` in JUnit 4) should be a static method because it is executed before an instance of the test class is created. It is used for initializing shared resources.

6. **What is Mockito? And what are its limitations? What kind of tools can give help?** Mockito is a popular mocking framework for Java used in unit testing. It allows developers to create and configure mock objects for use in test cases to simulate the behavior of real objects.

   **Limitations:**

   - Cannot mock static methods, private methods, and constructors without using additional plugins or extensions like PowerMock.
   - Cannot mock final classes or methods directly (though this is addressed in recent versions with inline mocking).

   **Helpful Tools:**

   - **PowerMock**: Works well with Mockito to extend its capabilities to include mocking of static methods, private methods, and more.
   - **JUnit**: Often used together with Mockito for structuring and asserting conditions in tests.

7. **What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?**

   - **@Mock**: Used to create a mock instance of a class or interface. The mock does not retain the behavior (logic) of the original class but can be programmed to return specific values when its methods are called.
   - **@InjectMocks**: Used to create an instance of the class and injects mocks created with `@Mock` (or `@Spy`) into it. This is particularly useful when you want to inject mocked dependencies into the class under test.

8. **What is stubbing (define behaviors)?** Stubbing is a feature provided by mocking frameworks like Mockito where the test writer can define specific behaviors for the methods of mock objects. For example, you can stub a method to return a particular value when it is called with certain arguments, throwing an exception, or doing nothing.

9. **What is Mockito ArgumentMatchers?** ArgumentMatchers are used in Mockito when stubbing methods to allow flexible verification or stubbing. They provide a way to specify the behavior of mocks for a broad range of input arguments, such as any integer, any string, or any custom object, instead of specifying exact values.

10. **What is Hamcrest Matchers?** Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects, allowing 'match' rules to be defined declaratively. In testing, it is commonly used with JUnit and other frameworks for more readable assertions. It provides a library of matcher objects (like `equalTo`, `hasItem`, `anyOf`), making the tests more expressive and readable.

11. **Do you know @Spy? What is the difference between @Spy and @Mock?**

    - **@Spy:** Creates a spy instance of the class. Spies delegate calls to the actual object but allow for specific methods to be stubbed or verified. Essentially, a spy wraps an existing instance of a class or creates a spy of a class, retaining the original behavior but allowing some of the functionality to be overridden.
    - The main difference between `@Spy` and `@Mock` is that a mock completely replaces the mocked class and only has the behavior you define for it, whereas a spy partially mocks an object, retaining some of its original behavior.

12. **What is assertion?** In the context of testing, an assertion is a statement in the test code that checks whether a condition is true. If the condition evaluates to true, the test passes for that assertion. If it evaluates to false, the test fails, indicating a potential bug in the code being tested.

13. **If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? And what kind of tests are written by you? What is the purpose of each type of tests?** For a new feature, various types of tests could be written, including:

    - **Unit Tests:** Test individual units of code (like functions or methods) in isolation from the rest of the system to ensure they work as expected.
    - **Integration Tests:** Test the interactions between components or systems to verify they work together as intended.
    - **Functional Tests:** Test the feature to ensure it behaves according to the specified requirements.
    - **End-to-End Tests (E2E):** Test the entire application in an environment that mimics real-world use to ensure all user flows work as expected.
    - **Performance Tests:** Assess the system's behavior under a particular workload, focusing on aspects like responsiveness and stability.

    Each type of test serves a different purpose, from validating the logic of small units of code to ensuring that the entire application functions correctly in a production-like environment.
