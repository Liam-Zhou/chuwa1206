2. Selenium is a tool for automating web browser actions. It's used to test web applications. 
3. Cucumber is a tool for Behavior-Driven Development, used for writing automated tests with high readability. It allows 
developers to describe software features in natural language. 
4. JMeter is an open-source tool for performance and load testing. It can test static and dynamic resources, measuring 
the performance of applications. 
5. (1) `@BeforeClass`: Executed once before all test methods in the current class.
   (2) `@Before`: Executed before each test method.
   (3) `@Test`: Execution of the test method.
   (4) `@After`: Executed after each test method.
   (5) `@AfterClass`: Executed once after all test methods in the current class. 
6. Yes. `@BeforeAll` method should be class level which is static. 
7. Mockito is a mocking framework for Java, mainly used in unit tests to mock behaviour of classes and interfaces. 

Limitation:  
(1) Can't mock static methods. (before Mockito 3.4.0)  
(2) Can't mock constructors  
(3) Can't mock private methods  
(4) Can't mock final classes and methods  

Helpful tools:  
(1) PowerMock: Can mock static methods, constructors, private methods and final classes\methods
(2) JMockit: Offers more extensive mocking capabilities.  
8. `@Mock`: Used for creating mock objects. In a test class, you can annotate fields with it, and Mockito will automatically
create mock objects for those fields.   
`@InjectMocks`: Used for creating an instance of the class and automatically injecting mock objects marked with `@Mock`
into it. 
9. Stubbing is the process of defining the behavior of mock objects in unit testing. It allows you to set expected return
values or behaviour of specific method calls. instead of executing the actual code logic. 
```
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

public class SomeTest {
    @Test
    public void testStubbing() {
        // 创建一个模拟对象
        List mockedList = mock(List.class);

        // 定义模拟对象的行为
        when(mockedList.get(0)).thenReturn("first element");

        // 使用模拟对象
        System.out.println(mockedList.get(0)); // 将输出 "first element"

        // 未定义的调用将返回默认值，例如null
        System.out.println(mockedList.get(99)); // 将输出 null
    }
}
```
10. Mockito's `ArgumentMatchers` are tools for specifying flexible matching rules for method parameters when stubbing or
verifying methods calls. They allow you to use generic matchers instead of specific argument values. 
For example:
```
    any(): Matches any value.
    eq(value): Matches an argument equal to value.
    anyInt(), anyString(), etc.: Match any argument of a specific type.
```
11. Hamcrest Matchers is a library for constructing flexible and readable assertion statements, commonly used in unit 
testing. It provides a range of matchers for comparison and validation of various objects and data types. For example:
```
assertThat(x, is(3)): Verifies if x is equal to 3.
assertThat(list, hasItem(item)): Checks if a list contains a specific item.
assertThat(string, containsString(substring)): Verifies if a string contains a specific substring.
```
12. `@Spy` and `@Mock` are used to create mock objects.  
    (1) `@Mock` creates a complete mock object where all methods by default do not execute real logic and return the 
default value of the type or null.  
    (2) `@Spy` creates a `spy` object, which means it defaults to using the real object's behaviour. If there's no explicit
subbing, the spy object will perform real method calls. 
13. Assertion is a way to check if a condition is true in a program. In unit testing, assertions are used to verify if 
the code behaves as expected. If the condition of the assertion fails, the test is marked as failed.   
14. (1) Unit Tests: Written by developers. Purpose is to verify the smallest testable parts of the code work as expected.   
    (2) Integration Tests: Written by Developer or QA Engineers. Purpose is to ensure different modules or services work together.  
    (3) System Tests: Written by QA Professionals. Purpose is to verify that the system or application meets specifications and requirement.
