What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. It works by adding additional behavior to existing code without modifying the code itself, typically using a "weaving" process.

# 4

What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?

Advantages of Spring AOP include improved code modularity, easier maintainability by separating cross-cutting concerns, and the ability to add new behaviors to existing code without direct modification. However, its disadvantages are potential performance overhead, complexity in understanding and debugging the code, and limited AOP support compared to pure AOP frameworks.

# 5

What is Aspect in Spring AOP?

In Spring AOP, an Aspect is a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes, such as logging or transaction management. It is typically a class that contains methods representing various cross-cutting concerns.

# 6

What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?

A Pointcut in Spring AOP is an expression that matches certain join points in the program. It is used to determine where advice should be applied, allowing for fine-grained control over which method executions are intercepted.

# 7

What is the Join point in Spring AOP?

A Join point in Spring AOP refers to a point in the execution of the program, such as method execution or object creation, where an aspect can be applied.

# 8

What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?

Advice in Spring AOP is an action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. Different types of advice include "before" (executed before the join point), "after" (executed after the join point), "after-returning" (executed after a successful return), "after-throwing" (executed if a method exits by throwing an exception), and "around" (encompassing the join point, offering the opportunity to perform custom behavior before and after the method execution).

When to use Spring Batch?

Spring Batch should be used for processing large volumes of data, like batch processing in a scheduled, repetitive manner. It's ideal for data migration, processing large files, and running complex batch jobs where data needs to be processed in a reliable and transactional manner.

# 11

How Spring Batch works?

Spring Batch works by providing a framework for the development and execution of batch processes. It offers tools for logging/tracing, transaction management, job processing statistics, job restart, skip, and resource management. It follows a typical batch architecture with a JobRepository, JobLauncher, Job, Steps, and ItemReader/Writer/Processor components.

# 12

How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?

A Spring Batch Job can be scheduled using task scheduling in Spring, like with the @Scheduled annotation, or by integrating with scheduling tools like Quartz. These methods allow for setting up recurring jobs based on time intervals or cron expressions.

# 13

What is the cron expression?

A cron expression is a string representing a schedule in a time-based job-scheduling format. It consists of fields representing different time units and is used in scheduling systems like cron in Unix or the Quartz scheduler in Java.

# 14

What is the spring task?

A Spring task refers to a scheduled task in the Spring Framework, used for executing periodic or scheduled jobs. These tasks are managed through annotations or XML configurations, allowing developers to schedule jobs without needing an external scheduler.

# 15

When to use Spring task?

Spring tasks are used when there is a need to execute periodic or scheduled tasks, such as sending out periodic emails, running cleanup jobs, or performing regular data synchronization. They are suitable for lightweight tasks and when application-level task scheduling is sufficient.

# 16

What is Filter and any filter example?

In the context of Java web applications, a Filter is a reusable code segment that can perform filtering tasks on the request to and the response from a servlet. An example is a logging filter that logs the details of every request and response.

# 17

What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?

An Interceptor in Spring is similar to a Filter but more powerful. It allows you to intercept and process web requests and responses, and modify them if necessary. Interceptors can be used for tasks like logging, security checks, transaction management, and performance monitoring.

# 18

In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?

In a Spring Interceptor, `preHandle` is a method called before the actual handler is executed. It can be used to perform operations before sending the request to the controller. `postHandle` is called after the handler method is executed, and it can be used for post-processing such as modifying the ModelAndView object.

What is Swagger?

Swagger is an open-source software framework backed by a large ecosystem of tools that helps developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with an APIâ€™s resources and understand its capabilities without accessing the source code.
