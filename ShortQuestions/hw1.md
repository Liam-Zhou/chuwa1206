How do you understand PR is based on Branch?

就是一般从主分支里面拉取一个自己的分支，然后在这个分支上干活，弄完之后上传自己的分支。那么这个时候，主分支和我自己的这个分支就存在了差别，我就可以去github创建一个pull request。一旦这个pull request通过之后，这个分支就可以合并到主分支里面来了，然后可以把这个pull request关掉了。

Maven is a software project management tool, primarily used for Java projects. It automates the build process, manages dependencies by downloading necessary libraries, ensures project standardization, and supports testing automation. Maven is known for its project lifecycle management and plugin-based architecture, which integrates well with continuous integration and delivery systems.



# 10

What is the lifecycle of maven? could you tell me the details ?

The lifecycle of Maven is a central part of its build process, defining the phases of the build. Maven has three main built-in lifecycles: `default`, `clean`, and `site`.

**Clean Lifecycle**: This lifecycle is intended to clean the project, ensuring no residual files from previous builds. 

**Default Lifecycle**: This is Maven's primary lifecycle, used for the actual project build and deployment. 

**Site Lifecycle**: Used for creating the project's site documentation.

Packaging is about turning the code into a complete file, while installation is about placing this file in a location that is easily accessible to other projects.
