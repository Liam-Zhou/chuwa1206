    | Phase             | Handles                    | Description                                                                        |
    | ----------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | prepare resources | resource copying           | Resource copying can be customized in this phase.                                  |
    | validate          | Validating the information | Validates if the project is correct and if all necessary information is available. |
    | compile           | compilation                | Source code compilation is done in this phase.                                     |
    | Test              | Testing                    | Tests the compiled source code suitable for testing framework.                     |
    | package           | packaging                  | This phase creates the JAR/WAR package as mentioned in the packaging in POM.xml.   |
    | install           | installation               | This phase installs the package in local/remote maven repository.                  |
    | Deploy            | Deploying                  | Copies the final package to the remote repository.                                 |

11. What is the difference between package and install in maven lifecycle?

12. What is plugins in maven, list some plugins.

    In Maven, plugins are extensions that provide additional capabilities to the build process. They are used to perform various tasks and goals during different phases of the Maven build lifecycle. Plugins can be bound to specific phases, and they contribute to the overall build process.
