- package: creates the JAR/WAR package as mentioned in the packaging in POM.xml.

- install: installs the package in local/remote maven repository.

## 12 What is plugins in maven

- Plugins are the central feature of Maven that allow for the reuse of common build logic across multiple projects. They do this by executing an "action" (i.e. creating a WAR file or compiling unit tests) in the context of a project's description - the Project Object Model (POM). Plugin behavior can be customized through a set of unique parameters which are exposed by a description of each plugin goal (or Mojo).

- Some Maven plugins:
  - clean
  - compiler
  - deploy
  - failsafe
