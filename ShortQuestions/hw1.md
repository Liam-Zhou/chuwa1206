`git pull`
`git push main:bar`

## Q3
git init
## Q4
git clone
## Q5
git checkout -b branch_name
## Q6
git branch branch_test

git checkout master

git merge branch_test

## Q7
### command

git checkout main

git checkout branch_learn_stash

git stash pop

### IDE

## Q8
PR suggests merging changes from (eg.feature branch) to (eg.master). It plays the role as a discussion platform for code modifications before merging

## Q9
### role
1. manage dependencies (packages)
2. build project (cycle)
3. reporting
4. others

### to do what
easy to download add and remove the dependencies/libraries

## Q10
mvnClean -> prepare-resources -> validate -> package -> install

mvn clean -> used to delete all the project jar that are built by Maven

prepare-resources -> resource copying can be customized in this phase

validate -> validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available

compile -> compile the source code of the project

test -> test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework

package -> take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR

verify -> run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteriaâ€™s are met

install: install the package into the local repository, for using as a dependency in other projects locally

deploy: done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects

## Q11
Package: Creates the distributable artifact and places it in the target directory.

Install: Does everything "package" does and additionally installs the artifact in the local Maven repository, making it available for other projects within the local development environment.

## Q12
They are extensions which provide additional functionality to the build process, in the `pom.xm1` file
