## Q9 What is maven role ? what it be used to do ?

## Q10 What is the lifecycle of maven?
1. **prepare resources**: Resource copying can be customized in this phase.
2. **validate**: Validates the project, making sure it is correct and all necessary information is available.
3. **compile**: Compiles the source code of the project.
4. **test**: Runs unit tests for the complied code.
5. **package**: Takes the compiled code and packages it in its distributable format(JAR/WAR).
6. **install**: Installs the package into the local/remote repository.
7. **deploy**: Copies the final package to the remote repository.

## Q11 What is the difference between package and install in maven lifecycle ?
The package phase is responsible for taking the compiled source code and packaging it into a distributable format, such as a JAR (Java Archive), WAR (Web Archive), or other specified formats.
The install phase builds upon the package phase. It not only packages the artifact but also installs it in the local Maven repository for use in other local Maven projects.

## Q12 What is plugins in maven, list some plugins.

In Maven, plugins are extensions that provide additional goals and tasks to the build process.

Maven plugins are typically configured in the `pom.xml` file.

Here are some commonly used Maven plugins:

1. **`maven-compiler-plugin`:**
	- **Purpose:** Compiles Java source code.
2. **`maven-surefire-plugin`:**
	- **Purpose:** Runs unit tests.
3. **`maven-jar-plugin`:**
	- **Purpose:** Creates a JAR (Java Archive) file from the compiled classes.
4. **`maven-clean-plugin`:**
	- **Purpose:** Cleans the project by deleting the target directory.
5. **`maven-install-plugin`:**
	- **Purpose:** Installs the project's artifact in the local Maven repository. 
6. **`maven-deploy-plugin`:**
