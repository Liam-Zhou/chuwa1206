## 2. practice git

<https://learngitbranching.js.org/>

1. **Initializing a Repository:**
   - `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.

2. **Cloning:**
   - `git clone <repository-url>`: Clone a remote repository to your local machine.

3. **Checking Status:**
   - `git status`: Show the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.

4. **Adding Changes:**
   - `git add <file>`: Stage a file for the next commit.
   - `git add .` or `git add --all`: Stage all changes for the next commit.

5. **Committing:**
   - `git commit -m "Commit message"`: Commit staged changes with a message.

6. **Branching:**
   - `git branch`: List all branches in the repository.
   - `git branch <branch-name>`: Create a new branch.
   - `git checkout <branch-name>`: Switch to a different branch.
   - `git merge <branch-name>`: Merge changes from one branch into the current branch.

7. **Remote Repositories:**
   - `git remote -v`: Show the remote repositories configured.
   - `git push <remote> <branch>`: Push changes to a remote repository.
   - `git pull <remote> <branch>`: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.

8. **Viewing History:**
   - `git log`: Show the commit history.
   - `git log --oneline`: Show a compact version of the commit history.

## 3. What is the basic steps to init a git repo in you local ?

To initialize a Git repository locally, follow these basic steps:

1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:**
   1. `mkdir chuwa1206`

2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory:**
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you want to create your Git repository.

   ```bash
   cd chuwa1206
   ```

3. **Initialize the Git Repository:**
   - Run the following command to initialize a new Git repository in the current directory.

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

4. **Check the Status :**
   - check the status of your new repository using:

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

   This will show you any untracked files and the current status of your repository.

5. **Add and Commit Your Files:**
   - Use the following commands to stage and commit your files:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

   The `git add .` command stages all changes, and `git commit -m "Initial commit"` creates a commit with a message.
6. **push changes**

    ```bash
    git push -u origin master
    ```

## 4. How to clone a repo from Github ?

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
## 5. How to create a new branch and checkout to that branch ?

- option 1:

```bash
git branch <mybrach>
git checkout <mybrach>
```

- option 2:

```bash
git checkout -b <mybranch>
```

## 6. How to merge the branch_test to master branch in command ? show me the commands

```bash
# First, switch to the master branch
git checkout master

# to make sure updated
git pull origin master

# Merge the changes from branch_test into the master branch
git merge branch_test
git push origin master
```

## 7. How to stash your new code before leaving branch branch_learn_stash and pop your stash when you checkout back to **branch_learn_stash ? try commands way and intellij way

```bash
1. git stash
2. git checkout <anotherbranch>
3. git checkout <branch_learn_stash>
4. git stash pop
```

## 8. How do you understand PR is based on Branch?

A PR is a pull request, which requesting merge my changes to another or main branch. it is usually used to merge changes from my current branch to the target branch.

## 9. What is maven role ? what it be used to do ?

maven is a build tool and dependency mangement tool for java projects. maven is like NPM in node.js

## 10. What is the lifecycle of maven? could you tell me the details ?

1. **Clean Lifecycle:**
   - **clean:** This phase removes all files generated by the previous build. It is often used before a new build to ensure a clean and consistent starting point.

   ```bash
   mvn clean
   ```

2. **Build Lifecycle:**
   - **validate:** This phase validates the project, ensuring that all necessary information is available.

   - **compile:** This phase compiles the source code of the project.

   - **test:** This phase runs the unit tests for the project.

   - **package:** This phase takes the compiled code and packages it into a distributable format (e.g., JAR, WAR).

   - **verify:** This phase runs any checks on results of integration tests.

   - **install:** This phase installs the package into the local repository, making it available for other projects on the local machine.

   - **deploy:** This phase copies the final package to a remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

   The full default lifecycle can be executed with:

   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

   This will run all the phases up to and including the `install` phase.

3. **Site Lifecycle:**
   - **site:** This phase generates the project's site documentation.

   - **site-deploy:** This phase deploys the generated site documentation to a remote server.

   The site lifecycle can be executed with:

   ```bash
   mvn site
   ```

## 11.what is the difference between package and install in maven lifecycle ?

The `package` is for creating the packaged artifact in the target directory.

The `install` do the same but with extras, it copies the artifact to local Maven repository, making it available for other projects. it is used when some other projects have denpendency on others.

## 12. What is plugins in maven, list some plugins

In Maven, plugins are a set of goals (or tasks) that can be executed during the build lifecycle. Plugins provide a way to extend or customize the build process. They are configured in the `pom.xml` file, and each plugin can have one or more goals associated with it. Maven plugins are typically used for various tasks such as compiling code, running tests, packaging artifacts, generating documentation, and more.

some Maven plugins:

1. **Compiler Plugin:** Compiles Java source code.
2. **Surefire Plugin:** Runs unit tests.
3. **Jar Plugin:** Creates a JAR file of the project.
4. **Clean Plugin:** Deletes the `target` directory and other files generated during the build.
5. **Surefire Plugin**: Runs unit tests.
