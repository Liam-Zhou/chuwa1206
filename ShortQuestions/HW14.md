2. Key components and tools of microservices architecture include:  
(1) Service Discovery: Mechanisms for services to find and communicate with each other, with tools like Eureka, Zuul.  
(2) API Gateway: Acts as the single entry point to the system, providing routing, authentication, monitoring, etc.  
(3) Containerization: Packaging, deploying, and scaling services using Docker or Kubernetes.  
   (4) Configuration Management: External storage for managing service configurations, with tools like Spring Cloud Config, Consul Config.  
   (5) Load Balancing: Distribution client requests across services, with Hystrix being a popular choice.  
   (6) Circuit Breaker: Prevents failure from spreading across services, with Hystrix being a popular choice.  
   (7) Tracing and Monitoring: Monitors calls and performance between services, with tools like Prometheus, Zipkin.  
   (8) Message Queue: Supports asynchronous communication between services, with RabbitMQ, Kafka. 
3. Resilience Patterns are design patterns help applications to respond gracefully to unexpected failures and maintain a 
level of operational performance. There patterns are crucial in distributed systems, like microservices, where different 
parts of the application are deployed independently. (帮助程序更好的相应意外失败并保持一定的性能) Resilience pattern include:   
   (1) Retry: Automatically retrying an operation that has failed, hoping it will succeed in subsequent attempts.  
   (2) Circuit Breaker: Preventing a cascade of failures by temporarily blocking failing operations. 阻止失败操作，防止失败蔓延。
   (3) Timeout: Limiting the time waiting for an operation to complete to avoid system hang.
   (4) Fallback: Providing an alternative solution when a operation fails.
   (5) Bulkhead: Isolating elements of a application into pools so that if one fails, the others continue to function.
   (6) Rate Limiting: Controlling the number of requests to a service within a given timeframe to prevent overload. 

Circuit Breaker: 断路器  
The circuit breaker pattern is a design pattern used to prevent a system from performing operations that are likely 
to fail. The pattern is named after an electrical circuit breaker that cut off electric flow when a system is overloaded 
to prevent damage. 

When the number of failures crosses a threshold, the circuit breaker trips, and for the duration of a timeout period, 
all attempts to invoke the operation are automatically returned with an error.  失败超过阈值，断路器触发，暂停一段时间，就自动返回错误。
After the timeout expires, the circuit breaker allows a limited number of test requests to pass through. If these requests 
succeed, the circuit breaker resets and begins allowing normal operation. If they fail, the timeout period begins again.
(超过后，断路器允许有限数量的测试请求通过。如果请求成功，断路器重置并开始允许正常操作。如果失败，超时期重新开始。)
4. Benefit and Drawbacks of Microservice  
self-contained, and independent deployment module.   独立部署
Independently managed services.   独立管理
In order to improve performance, the demand service can be deployed on multiple servers.  为了性能可以部署在多台服务器上
It is easier to test and has fewer dependencies.  容易测试并依赖少
A greater degree of scalability and agility.   更高程度的可扩展性和敏捷性
Simplicity in debugging & maintenance   调试和维护简单

Due to the complexity of the architecture, testing and monitoring are more difficult.   架构复杂，测试监控难
Lacks the proper corporate culture for it to work.   缺乏企业文化来发挥作用
6. Service Discover is used to allow services to dynamically discover and communicate with each other. Service discovery 
can be implemented using two main approaches: client-side discovery and server-side discovery.   

Client-Side Discovery: In this approach, the client service is responsible for determining the network locations of 
available service instance and balancing the load between them. It typically queries a service registry, which is a database 
of available service instances. The client the uses a load-balancing algorithm to select an instance and makes a direct call 
to the chosen service instance.
在这种方法中，客户端服务负责确定可用服务实例的网络位置，并在它们之间平衡负载。它通常查询一个服务注册表，这是一个可用服务实例的数据库。然后客
户端使用负载均衡算法选择一个实例，并直接调用选定的服务实例。  
Sever-Side Discovery: 
In server-side discovery, the client service makes a request to a service, which is responsible for directing the request 
to an available service instance. This approach abstracts the discovery logic from the client, simplifying the client's 
implementation. The service gateway or load balancer queries the service registry and directs the client's request to an appropriate 
service instance.  
在服务器端发现中，客户端服务向一个服务（通常称为服务网关或负载均衡器）发出请求，该服务负责将请求定向到一个可用的服务实例。这种方法将发现逻辑从
客户端中抽象出来，简化了客户端的实现。服务网关或负载均衡器查询服务注册表，并将客户端的请求定向到适当的服务实例。  

7. main components in Kafka:  
   (1) Producer: producers publish data to topic
   (2) Consumer: Consumer read data from topic
   (3) Broker: Broker is a composed of multiple servers.
   (4) Topic: A topic is a category or feed to which records are published by producers.
   (5) Partition: Topic are split into partitions. This allow data to be distributed across cluster.
   (6) ZooKeeper: ZooKeeper is used to managing and coordinating Kafka brokers.
   (7) Consumer Group: is a set of consumer processes that are subscribing to a specific topic. 
8. A `partition` is a physical segmentation of a topic. Each topic can be divided into multiple partitions, where each 
partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of message records known as a commit. 
9. ZooKeeper is a distributed service used for coordinating and managing various operations within a Kafka cluster.
