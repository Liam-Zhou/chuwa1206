##### 2.how do you do the debug

First add some breakpoints in my code where I want to pause execution. Then start debugging, step over or step into at each line of code. View variable values through this process.

##### 3.What is DTO, VO, Payload, DO, model?

DTO: data transfer object, mutable, refers to data transferred between layers.

VO: Value Object, immutable, to ensure data integrity. Not have an id. Equal when two VOs's values are all equal.

Payload: refers to data being sent/received in API requests/responses

DO: Data Object, directly mapped to tables in Database.

Model: similar to DO

##### 4.What is @JsonProperty("description_yyds") 

Jackson will expect a property named "description_yyds" in JSON to be mapped to this field.

##### 5.do you know what is jackson

Jackson is a library to process JSON data, which can help serialize Java objects to JSON and deserialize JSON to Java objects.

##### 6.What is spring-boot-starter?

Spring-boot-starter refers to a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your spring boot application. Each Starter is a collection of dependencies.

```
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
   <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

This starter is spring-boot-starter-web, to build web applications.

Other spring-boot-starters:

Spring-boot-starter-data-jpa: For using Spring Data JPA with Hibernate.

spring-boot-starter-security,spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf

##### 7.do you know  @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST)  ? could you list 

##### CRUD by this style?

Yes. This defines a post method at /user.

@RequestMapping(value="/users",method=RequestMethod.GET)

@RequestMapping(value="/users/{id}",method=RequestMethod.PUT)

@RequestMapping(value="/users/{id}",method=RequestMethod.DELETE)

##### 8.What is ResponseEntity? why do we need it?

ResponseEntity allows us to define Http Response, including status and body. We need it to custom our own HTTP response for each api.

##### 9.What is ResultSet in jdbc? and describe the flow how to get data using JDBC

ResultSet is used as an iterator to get the data from the result of sql query execution.

To get data by JDBC:

Load JDBC Driver -> Create a Connection -> Create a statement -> execute a query -> process the  ResultSet -> close ResultSet and statement -> close Connection

##### 10.What is the ORM framework?

ORM (Object Relational Mapping) framework can let us use objects in a Object-Oriented programming language like Java to manipulate data in a relational database.

It embodies Database Agnosticism. Changing database (another relational database) is pretty easy.

It hide SQL details, reducing boilerplate and repetitive code, thus increasing productivity.

##### 11.learn to use Object Mapper

ObjectMapper is a class from Jackson library. It could serialize a Java Object to a JSON string, or deserialize a JSON String to a Java Object. objectMapper.readValue(resBody, FoodOutlet.class) converts resBody to an instance of FoodOutlet class. ObjectMapper.writeValueAsString(foodOutlet) serialize foodOutlet back to a JSON string.

objectMapper.readTree() will present a way to traverse and manipulate JSON data without deserializing it.

##### 12.What is the serialization and desrialization?

Serialization is the process of converting an object's state or data structure into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted. The format could be JSON, XML, binary, or any other format that is suitable for storing or transmitting data.

Deserialization is the reverse process of serialization. It involves converting data from a stored format (like a file, database, or received from a network) back into an object or data structure.

##### 13.

```Java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
    public static void streamGetAvg(int[] array){
        double avg= Arrays.stream(array).average().orElse(0.0);
        System.out.println(avg);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] lst={0, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32};
        streamGetAvg(lst);
    }
}
```
