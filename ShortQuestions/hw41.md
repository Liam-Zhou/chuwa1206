- DTO (data transfer object)
  - it's used to transfer data btwn software application subsystems or layers
  - it represents a lightweight, serializable object with no business logic
  - it aimed at reducing the number of method calls and reducing data transfer overhead
- VO(value object)
  - it represents a descriptive aspect of the domain with no conceptual identity
  - it is immutable and should be treated as read-only
  - it's used to encapsulate simple types or combinations of simple types
- Payload
  - it refers to data transmitted in message or request in a specific format
  - in web services, it represents the data part of a http request/response
  - may include dto, vo, or other data structure
- Model
  - the representation of data and business logic in an application
  - it can include a combination of entities, vo, and dto
### 4
- `@JsonProperty` specifies the JSON property name to be used for serialization and deser-
- the description property of the class will be serialized as "description_yyds" when converting the object to JSON
### 5
Jackson is a widely-used Java library for JSON processing, working with JSON data. The dependency provides necessary Jackson library components and facilitating the conversion btwn Java objects and JSON representation
### 6
Spring-boot-stater is the core dependencies needed for any SpringBoot application. It includes essential components for managing configuration, logging. It automatically included when creating a new Spring Boot project
### 6.1
- `spring-web` provides core functionality for building web applications with Srping
- `-data-jpa`: work with database using Spring Data JPA, hibernate, spring data jpa
- `-security`: add security features to application
- `-test`: test spring boot applications,
- `-validation`: enable data validation in application, hibernate validator
### 7
`@RequestMapping` is used to map web requests to specific methods in a controller
- `@RequstMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)`
- `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)`
- `@RequestMapping(value = "/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)`
- `@RequestMapping(value = "/{id}", method = RequestMethod.PUT)`
- `@RequestMapping(value = "/{id}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)`
### 8
- It's a class in the Spring Framework that represents the entire HTTP response. It allows us to control the response status, headers, and body when building a web application
- usages
  - status and header control: set the http status code and headers for the response (200, 201, 202) and add custom headers to the response
  - flexible body handling: wrap the actual response body, allow us to customize the data returned to the client
  - handling success and error: eg., return 404 if the requested resource is not found
### 9
- it's an interface provided by Java to represent the result set of a database query, acts as iterator and allows us to retrieve and navigate through the data
- flow
  - load JDBC driver: load the driver with corresponding database
  - establish connection: connected to database
  - create statement: execute SQL queries
  - execute query
  - retrieve data: using `getString`, `getInt`, `getDouble`
  - close
### 10
ORM(Object-Relational Mapping) enables seamless integration btwn oop and relational database.
Hibernate is a commonly used for Java application, supports JPA
### 11
`ObjectMapper` is a part of JackSom library in Java, used for converting Java objects to JSON(serialization) and JSON to Java(deserialization)
### 12
- Serialization
  - is a process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted
  - saving the state of an object or for transmitting data over a network
- Deserialization
  - is the process of reconstructing an object or data structure from a serialized format
  - to store the state of an object or to retrieve data transmitted over a network
- Enable data persistence, communication btwn system, and efficient storage and retrieval of data
