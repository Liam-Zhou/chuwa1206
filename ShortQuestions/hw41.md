## Q2. How do you do the debug?
Set breakpoint and turn on the debug mode.

## Q3. What is DTO, VO, Payload, DO, model?
- DTO: DTOs are used to transfer data between different parts of an application or between applications, especially in API layers or service layers. They're often used to encapsulate data and send it from the backend to the frontend or between microservices.

- VO: VOs represent objects with equality defined in terms of their value rather than their identity. They are used to model concepts with important domain significance.

- Payload: In the context of communications (especially in APIs), the payload refers to the actual data being transmitted in a request or response body.

- DO : DOs, or Domain Objects, represent the business entities within the application domain. They contain both data and behavior that is relevant to the business domain.

- Model: In many MVC frameworks, the model represents the data structure, business logic, and functions to manage data.

## Q4. What is @JsonProperty("description_yyds")?
By using @JsonProperty("description_yyds"), you're instructing Jackson to map the Java field or getter/setter method to a JSON property named description_yyds. 

## Q5. Do you know what is jackson?
Jackson is a popular Java library used for serializing Java objects to JSON and deserializing JSON strings to Java objects. It's widely used for working with RESTful web services in Java.

## Q6. What is spring-boot-stater? what dependecies in the below starter? do you know any starters?
Spring Boot Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application. They provide a quick way to pull in all the dependencies required for a specific type of application or functionality. Each starter is designed to simplify the Maven or Gradle configuration.

The below starter includes spring-boot-starter-web.The spring-boot-starter-web is a starter dependency in Spring Boot that simplifies the setup of web applications. 

## Q7. Do you know  @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST)  ? could you list CRUD by this style?
`@RequestMapping` annotation in Spring MVC is used to map web requests to Spring Controller methods. It can specify the URL path, HTTP method, and other request parameters.
CRUD: 
- @GetMapping for RequestMethod.GET
- @PostMapping for RequestMethod.POST
- @PutMapping for RequestMethod.PUT
- @DeleteMapping for RequestMethod.DELETE
- @PatchMapping for RequestMethod.PATCH


## Q8. What is ResponseEntity?
ResponseEntity is a type in Spring Framework used to represent an entire HTTP response, including status code, headers, and body. It allows for more complete control over the response sent back to the client in a Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application.


## Q9. What is ResultSet in jdbc? and describe the flow how to get data using JDBC
In Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), a ResultSet is an object that represents the data returned by executing SQL queries against a database. It acts as a table of data representing a database result set, where each row corresponds to a record in the database, and each column represents a data field. The ResultSet object maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of data, and this cursor can be moved to navigate through the rows.

Flow to Get Data Using JDBC:
1. Load the JDBC Driver:
```java
Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"); // Example for MySQL. Often not needed with newer JDBC versions.
```

2. Establish a Connection:: Use the DriverManager to establish a connection to the database by providing the JDBC URL, username, and password.
```java
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase", "username", "password");
```

3. Create a Statement: Create a Statement or PreparedStatement object to execute the SQL query.
```java
Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?");
preparedStatement.setInt(1, userId); // Setting parameter
```

4. Execute the Query: Execute the SQL query using the Statement or PreparedStatement object. This returns a ResultSet object for queries that produce data.
```java
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users");
ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();

```

5. Process the ResultSet: Iterate over the ResultSet to process the returned data. 
6. Close Resources: It's crucial to close the ResultSet, Statement/PreparedStatement, and Connection objects to free up database resources. This is typically done in a finally block or using try-with-resources to ensure resources are always released.
```java
resultSet.close();
statement.close();
connection.close();

```

## Q10. What is the ORM framework?
An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework is a tool in software development that facilitates the mapping and management of data between an object-oriented programming language and a relational database. 

## Q12. What is the serialization and desrialization?
Serialization and deserialization are processes used in computer science and data communication to convert complex data structures, objects, or data from one format or representation into another, typically for the purpose of storage, transmission, or interchange between different systems or platforms.

## Q13. Use stream api to get the average of the array [20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32].
```java
double average = Arrays.stream(numbers)
                .average()
                .orElse(0.0);
```
