# 4. What is JPA? and what is Hibernate?

JPA (Java Persistence API) is a Java specification for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects and relational databases. Hibernate is an implementation of the JPA specifications. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a traditional relational database.

# 5. What is Hikari? What are the benefits of a connection pool?

HikariCP is a high-performance JDBC connection pool. The benefits of using a connection pool like HikariCP include reduced wait time for database connections, better resource management, and overall improved application performance due to reusable connections.

# 6. What are the @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany? Write some examples.

- `@OneToMany`: Defines a one-to-many relationship between two entities. Example: A `User` entity having multiple `Order` entities.
- `@ManyToOne`: Defines a many-to-one relationship. Example: Each `Order` entity belonging to one `User`.
- `@ManyToMany`: Defines a many-to-many relationship. Example: A `Student` entity having multiple `Course` entities, and each `Course` can have multiple `Student` entities.

# 7. What is the cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true? And what are the other CascadeType and their features? In which situation do we choose which one?

- `cascade = CascadeType.ALL`: This option indicates that all JPA lifecycle events (persist, remove, refresh, merge, detach) are cascaded from the parent to the child entity.
- `orphanRemoval = true`: Automatically removes child entities when they are no longer referenced from the parent entity. Other `CascadeType` options include `PERSIST`, `MERGE`, `REMOVE`, `REFRESH`, and `DETACH`, each corresponding to a different lifecycle operation. The choice depends on the specific requirements of the relationship between entities.

# 8. What is the fetch = FetchType.LAZY, fetch = FetchType.EAGER? What is the difference? In which situation do you choose which one?

- `FetchType.LAZY`: Loads the related entities lazily, i.e., on demand.
- `FetchType.EAGER`: Loads the related entities immediately with the main entity. `LAZY` is generally used to improve performance when related entities are not immediately required. `EAGER` is used when the related entities are always used with the main entity.

# 9. What is the rule of JPA naming convention? Shall we implement the method by ourselves? Could you list some examples?

JPA relies on specific naming conventions, like entity names corresponding to table names and entity field names to column names. Custom methods can be implemented, especially in repositories. Examples include `findByUsername`, `findAllByLastnameOrderByFirstnameAsc`.



# 10. Try to use JPA advanced methods in your class project. In the repository layer, you need to use the naming convention to use the method provided by JPA.

# 13. What is JPQL?

JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) is a query language used in JPA to write queries against entities stored in a relational database. It is similar to SQL but operates on entity objects rather than tables.

# 14. What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?

- `@NamedQuery`: Defines a static query with a given name at the entity level.
- `@NamedQueries`: Used to define multiple `@NamedQuery` annotations.

# 15. What is @Query? In which Interface do we write the SQL or JPQL?

`@Query` is used to define repository methods with custom JPQL or SQL queries. This annotation is typically used in Spring Data JPA repositories.

# 16. What is HQL and Criteria Queries?

HQL (Hibernate Query Language) is an object-oriented query language similar to SQL, but designed for Hibernate. Criteria Queries are a programmatic way to build queries in Hibernate, providing a type-safe API for query construction.

# 17. What is EntityManager?

EntityManager is a JPA interface used to interact with the persistence context. It provides methods to create, read, and remove entities.

# 18. What is SessionFactory and Session?

SessionFactory is a Hibernate interface that creates Session instances. A Session represents a single-threaded unit of work with the database and is the primary interface for interacting with the database in Hibernate.

# 19. What is Transaction? How do you manage your transaction?

A Transaction in JPA/Hibernate represents a unit of work with the database. Transactions are managed using the `EntityTransaction` interface in JPA or by configuring transaction management in Spring.

# 20. What is Hibernate Caching?

Hibernate caching refers to the mechanism of storing frequently queried data in memory to improve application performance. It includes first-level (session) cache and optional second-level cache.

# 21. What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?

First-level cache is associated with the `Session` and is enabled by default. It stores objects within the current session. Second-level cache is associated with the `SessionFactory` and is optional, shared across sessions, and typically involves configuring an external cache provider.

# 22. How do you understand @Transactional?

`@Transactional` is an annotation used in Spring to declare that a method should be executed within a transactional context. It helps manage transaction boundaries, rollbacks, and propagation behavior.
