# 2. What is Spring and Spring Boot? What are the benefits of using Spring Boot?

Spring is a powerful, lightweight framework for building Java applications. Spring Boot is a tool that makes developing web applications and microservices with Spring easier. Benefits of using Spring Boot include easy dependency management, embedded servers, simplified configuration, and production-ready features like metrics.

# 3. What is IOC and What is DI?

IOC (Inversion of Control) is a principle where the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework. DI (Dependency Injection) is a design pattern used to implement IOC, where dependencies are injected into objects rather than being created by the objects themselves.

# 4. What is @ComponentScan?

`@ComponentScan` is an annotation in Spring that configures which packages the framework should scan for components, configurations, and services. It's used to automatically detect and register beans.

# 5. How to define which package Spring needs to scan in XML and annotation?

In XML, packages to scan are defined using the `<context:component-scan base-package="..."/>` tag. In annotation-based configuration, `@ComponentScan` is used with the `basePackages` attribute to specify the packages.

# 6. What is @SpringBootApplication?

`@SpringBootApplication` is a convenience annotation in Spring Boot that combines `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan` annotations. It's used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application.

# 7. How many ways can we define a bean?

Beans can be defined in several ways in Spring, including:

- Annotation-based configuration (using `@Bean`, `@Component`, etc.)
- XML-based configuration
- Java-based configuration (using `@Configuration` and `@Bean` annotations)

# 8. What is the default bean name for @Component and @Bean?

The default bean name for a `@Component` or `@Bean` is the uncapitalized class name. For example, `myService` for a class named `MyService`.

# 9. What is the difference between @Component, @Service, and @Repository?

`@Component` is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component. `@Service` annotates classes at the service layer. `@Repository` annotates classes at the persistence layer, indicating that the class is a data repository.

# 10. How many annotations can we use to inject the bean?

Common annotations for injecting beans include `@Autowired`, `@Inject`, and `@Resource`.

# 11. Tell me the three types of dependency injection (How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?

The three types of dependency injection in Spring are:

- Constructor Injection
- Setter Injection
- Field Injection Constructor Injection is often considered better because it allows for immutable fields and clearer dependencies.

# 12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one as primary? And how to let Spring pick one bean to inject if no primary.

Use `@Primary` on one of the beans to mark it as primary. If no primary is set, use `@Qualifier` annotation to specify which bean to inject.

# 13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?

`BeanFactory` is a basic container that manages beans. `ApplicationContext` is a more advanced container that adds more enterprise-specific functionality like event propagation, AOP features, and more.

# 14. What is the Scope of a Bean? And list examples for each scope.

Common scopes for beans include:

- Singleton (default): One instance per Spring container.
- Prototype: A new instance for each request.
- Request: One instance per HTTP request.
- Session: One instance per HTTP session.
- GlobalSession: One instance per global HTTP session.

# 15. Configure a bean using XML. If a bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean?

In XML configuration, a bean can be configured using the `<bean>` tag. Dependencies are injected using `<constructor-arg>` for constructor injection or `<property>` for setter injection. For example:

``` Java
<bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyClass">
    <constructor-arg ref="anotherBean"/>
    <property name="myProperty" value="someValue"/>
</bean>

```
