### Question 1:
@Bean
@Configuration

### Question 2:
@Configuration
Purpose: It is a class-level annotation in Spring. It indicates that the class has @Bean definition methods. So, Spring container can process the class and generate Spring Beans to be used in the application.
Usage: Typically used to define configuration logic. It replaces the XML-based configuration in earlier versions of Spring.

@Bean
Purpose: It is a method-level annotation. It signifies that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container.
Usage: Within a class annotated with @Configuration, methods annotated with @Bean will instantiate, configure and return an object to be registered as a bean within the Spring application context.

### Question 3:
@ExceptionHandler: Used to handle exceptions in specific controller classes.
ControllerAdvice: A global error handling component. It allows you to handle exceptions across the whole application, not just to an individual controller.
ResponseEntityExceptionHandler: Provides a mechanism to handle exceptions and return a ResponseEntity object.

### Question 4:
Annotate your model attributes with validation annotations.
Use @Valid annotation in your controller methods to activate the validation process for incoming objects.

### Question 5:
Spring Boot Actuator is a Spring Boot sub-project. It provides several production-ready features to monitor and manage your application.
health: Shows application health information.
info: Displays arbitrary application info.
metrics: Shows various metrics information for the application.
env: Exposes properties from Springâ€™s ConfigurableEnvironment.
loggers: Shows and modifies the configuration of loggers in the application.
heapdump: Returns a GZip compressed JVM heap dump.
