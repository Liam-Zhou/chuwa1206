* List all of the new annotations to your annotaitons.md and explain its role.
- `@SpringBootApplication`:Marks the main class of a Spring Boot application. It combines three annotations: @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan. This annotation is often placed on the class containing the main method.
- `@Controller`:Marks a class as a Spring MVC controller. Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and define the methods to process those requests.
- `@RestController`:A specialized version of @Controller. It is used to create RESTful web services. It combines @Controller and @ResponseBody.
- `@RequestMapping`:Maps HTTP requests to specific handler methods. It can be applied at both the class and method levels.
- `@Autowired`:Marks a constructor, field, or method to be autowired by Spring's dependency injection. It is used to inject dependencies automatically.
- `@Service`:Marks a class as a service bean. Service beans hold the business logic and are typically used to encapsulate the application's business logic.
- `@Repository`:Marks a class as a data access object (DAO). It is used to indicate that the class defines a data repository.
- `@Component`:Marks a Java class as a Spring component. Spring components are typically used for auto-discovery and auto-registration of beans.
- `@Configuration`:Indicates that a class declares one or more @Bean methods. It plays a key role in Java-based configuration.
- `@EnableAutoConfiguration`:Enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration feature, allowing the application to automatically configure various beans based on the dependencies in the classpath.
- `@Value`: Injects values from external sources (e.g., properties files) into fields of a Spring bean.

* How to debug
  Using Integrated Development Environment (IDE), Logging, Remote Debugging,Spring Boot DevTools.
* stream average
 ```
      int[] res = { 20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32};
      System.out.println(Arrays.stream(res).average().getAsDouble());
```
* Dto,VO,DO,Payload,Model
- DTOs are objects used to transfer data between layers of an application, especially between the service layer and the presentation layer (e.g., REST controllers). DTOs help in reducing the number of method calls and improve performance by transferring the necessary data in a single object.
  VO (Value Object):
- Similar to DTOs, Value Objects represent values that don't have an intrinsic identity. They are used to group related attributes together. While DTOs focus on data transfer, VOs emphasize the immutability of the data they hold. In Spring Boot, the term VO is not as commonly used as DTO.
- Payload generally refers to the data transmitted in a communication between two components, such as the request or response body in a RESTful API. In the context of Spring Boot, you might see it mentioned in the context of HTTP requests and responses, where the payload is the data being sent or received.
- Domain Objects represent the core objects in the business domain. They encapsulate the business logic and rules of the application. These objects are typically persisted in a database and represent the state of the application's business entities.
-  In the context of Spring MVC and Spring Boot, the term "Model" usually refers to the data that is exposed to the view for rendering. It is often used in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. The Model in Spring MVC is a data structure that holds the information to be displayed on the view.

* What is @JsonProperty("description_yyds")
  it means that the Java property or field annotated with this annotation should be serialized or deserialized using the name "description_yyds" when interacting with JSON data.

* What is Jackson
  Jackson is a widely-used library for handling JSON data in Java, and it's often integrated with Spring applications to facilitate JSON processing. Specifically, Jackson provides functionalities for JSON serialization and deserialization, allowing Java objects to be easily converted to JSON format and vice versa.

* What is spring-boot-stater? what dependecies in the below starter? do you know any starters?
  spring-boot-starter-web brings in all the required dependencies for developing a web application.
  - `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`: For working with Spring Data JPA and relational databases.
  - `spring-boot-starter-security`: For adding Spring Security to your application.
  - `spring-boot-starter-test`: For including testing dependencies.

* Request Mapping
- @RequestMapping(value = "/users/{userId}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
- The @RequestMapping annotation in Spring is used to map HTTP requests to handler methods in a controller. It can be applied at both the class and method levels. 
- value = "/users": Specifies the URI path that the annotated method will handle. In this case, it is set to "/users," so the method will be invoked when an HTTP request is made to the "/users" endpoint.
- method = RequestMethod.POST: Specifies the HTTP request method. In this case, the method is set to POST, indicating that the annotated method will handle HTTP POST requests. This is commonly used for creating or submitting data to the specified URI.

* What is ResponseEntity? why do we need it
- `ResponseEntity` is a class in Spring Framework that represents the entire HTTP response, including status code, headers, and body. It is commonly used in Spring MVC and Spring Web applications to customize and control the HTTP response sent back to the client.

* ResultSet in JDBC
- a `ResultSet` is an interface in Java that represents the result set of a database query. It provides methods for traversing and manipulating the data retrieved from a database. 
 A ResultSet object maintains a cursor that points to the current row of data in the result set.

* ORM
  Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is often facilitated through the use of the Spring Data JPA module. JPA (Java Persistence API) is a specification for managing relational data in Java applications. Spring Data JPA is a part of the larger Spring Data project, which simplifies data access in Spring applications.

* Serialization and Deserialization :
- `Serialization` is the process of converting a data object—a combination of code and data represented within a region of data storage—into a series of bytes that saves the state of the object in an easily transmittable form.
- The reverse process—constructing a data structure or object from a series of bytes—is deserialization.
