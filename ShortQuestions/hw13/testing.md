### Question 1:
@Spy
@Mock
### Question 2:
Selenium is an open-source automated testing framework used to validate web applications across different browsers and platforms. It supports multiple programming languages and enables testers to write test scripts for various browser actions and validations.

### Question 3:
Cucumber is a tool that supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD), allowing developers to write specifications in plain language that can be understood by stakeholders and also serve as test documentation. It bridges the communication gap between developers, QA, and non-technical participants.

### Question 4:
JMeter is an open-source software designed for load testing and measuring performance. It can be used to test performance both on static and dynamic resources, simulating a heavy load on a server, network, or object to test its strength or analyze overall performance under different load types.

### Question 5:
Lifecycle of JUnit involves annotations that define specific test phases: @BeforeAll (before all tests), @BeforeEach (before each test), @Test (test methods), @AfterEach (after each test), and @AfterAll (after all tests).

### Question 6:
@BeforeAll methods should indeed be class-level (static) as they are executed once before all the tests in the class, serving to set up global test fixtures.

### Question 7:
Mockito is a mocking framework for unit tests in Java, allowing the simulation of external dependencies. Its limitations include the inability to mock private methods, constructors, and static methods directly. Tools like PowerMock can help overcome some of these limitations by extending Mockito's capabilities.

### Question 8:
@Mock is used to create a mock instance of a class or interface, while @InjectMocks is used to create an instance of a class and inject mocked dependencies into it.

### Question 9:
Stubbing refers to the practice of defining specific behaviors or responses for mocked objects when certain methods are called, allowing control over the behavior of mocks during testing.

### Question 10:
Mockito ArgumentMatchers allow specifying flexible argument conditions when stubbing methods, enabling mocks to respond differently based on the arguments passed to them.

### Question 11:
Hamcrest Matchers are a library of matcher objects used in assertions and validations, providing a more readable way to write tests, especially for complex assertions.

### Question 12:
@Spy is used to create a spy instance of a real object, allowing the overriding of some methods while still calling the real methods. The difference between @Spy and @Mock is that @Spy retains the original behavior of the class, whereas @Mock creates a complete mock with no original code being executed.

### Question 13:
Assertion is a statement in test code that verifies the state or behavior of the application against expected outcomes, throwing an error if the expectation is not met.

### Question 14:
ypes of tests for a new feature could include unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, and end-to-end tests. Each type serves a different purpose:

Unit tests check the functionality of specific components in isolation.
Integration tests ensure that different parts of the application work together correctly.
Functional tests validate the software against functional requirements.
End-to-end tests cover the application's workflow from beginning to end in its entirety.
