Document the microservice architeture and components/tools/dependencies

Microservice architecture involves structuring an application as a collection of small, autonomous services modeled around a business domain. Key components include Containers for encapsulation, Clustering and Orchestration for management, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for infrastructure setup, Cloud Infrastructure for scalability, API Gateways for interfacing, and Service Discovery for locating services. Common tools include Docker for containerization, Wiremock for simulating HTTP-based APIs, and Hystrix for latency and fault tolerance.

What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?

Resilience patterns in microservices are strategies to handle and recover from failures, ensuring system stability and reliability. The circuit breaker pattern is a resilience strategy that prevents a network or service failure from cascading to other parts of the system. It does this by monitoring for failures and, once a threshold is reached, "trips" to stop further failures, allowing the system to recover or redirect traffic until the issue is resolved.

a. https://www.interviewbit.com/microservices-interview-questions/#mai n-features-of-microservices

Explain continuous monitoring. Continuous monitoring in microservices involves the ongoing observation and analysis of the operational state and performance of services to identify and address issues proactively, ensuring system reliability and security.

What do you mean by Domain driven design? Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that focuses on complex needs by connecting the implementation to an evolving model of the core business concepts, facilitating collaboration between technical and domain experts to solve domain problems.

What are Reactive Extensions in Microservices? Reactive Extensions (Rx) in microservices refer to a programming model for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences, enabling efficient handling of streams of data and events with minimal resource consumption.

Explain Container in Microservices. Containers in microservices are lightweight, executable units of software that package code and all its dependencies, ensuring that the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another, facilitating microservices' deployment and scalability.

how to do load balance in microservice? Write a long Summary by yourself.

- **Round Robin**: Distributes requests sequentially across all servers.
- **Least Connections**: Prefers servers with the fewest active connections.
- **IP Hash**: Routes requests based on the hash of the client's IP address, ensuring a user consistently reaches the same server.

#### Service Discovery Integration

In dynamic environments, especially those hosted on cloud platforms, service instances can change rapidly. Integrating load balancing with service discovery mechanisms allows the load balancer to query a service registry to route traffic to healthy, available instances. This setup is crucial for microservices architecture, where services may be scaled up or down frequently.

#### Health Checks

Regular health checks are essential to ensure traffic is only directed to operational service instances. Load balancers continuously monitor the health of all instances and remove unhealthy ones from the pool, rerouting traffic to the remaining healthy instances.

#### SSL Termination

For secure applications, SSL termination at the load balancer can offload cryptographic operations from the service instances, improving performance. The load balancer decrypts incoming SSL/TLS connections and forwards plain traffic to the backend services, handling encryption for outgoing traffic.

#### Session Persistence

Certain applications require that a user's session be handled by the same service instance for the duration of their visit. Techniques like cookie-based session persistence or IP hashing ensure that requests from the same session are consistently routed to the same instance.





# 6

How to do service discovery?



Service discovery in microservices involves automatically detecting and cataloging services within a system, allowing services to find and communicate with each other. It typically uses a dedicated service registry, where services register themselves upon startup and deregister upon shutdown. Clients or other services query the registry to find the network locations of available service instances, enabling dynamic, flexible communication within microservice architectures.
