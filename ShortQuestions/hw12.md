### 3. Aspect Oriented Programming
AOP allows for the creation of relationships between different classes. Entails breaking down program logic into distinct parts.
### 4. advantages and disadvantages of AOP
benefits
- improves performance because operations are more succinct.
- allows programmers to spend less time rewriting the same code

disadvantages
- relatively high-cost process due to the use of costly chemicals and increased energy consumption.
### 5. Aspect 
A class that implements enterprise application concerns that cut across multiple classes, such as transaction management.
### 6. Pointcut
expressions that are matched with join points to determine whether advice needs to be executed or not.
### 7. join point
A point during the execution of a program such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception
### 8. Advice
action taken by an aspect at a particular join point
### 10. Spring Batch
Spring Batch provides reusable functions that are essential in processing large volumes of records, including logging/tracing, transaction management, job processing statistics, job restart, skip, and resource management.
### 11. how Spring Batch works
Spring Batch persists the ExecutionContext which helps in cases where you want to restart a batch run. All that is needed is to put any object to be shared between steps into the context and the framework will take care of the rest.
### 12. how to schedule a Spring Batch job
- use @EnableScheduling annotation
- create a method annotated with @Scheduled and providing recurrence details with the job.
### 13. cron expression
consist of five mandatory fields and one optional field, each field represents a unit of time such as minute, hour, day, month. And each field in the expression is seperated by a white space.
### 14. spring task
In Spring, tasks are often associated with the scheduling and execution of background jobs or repetitive tasks. The Spring Framework provides a scheduling framework through the TaskScheduler interface and related classes
### 15. when to use spring task
to schedule jobs, batch processing, timed execution and background processing
### 16. filter and filter example
filter dynamically intercepts requests and responses to transform or use the information contained in the requests or response.
### 17. Interceptor
Interceptor is an object that is invoked at the preprocessing and postprocessing of a request
### 18. preHandle and postHandle
- preHandle called before the execution of the actual handler
- postHandle called after the handler is executed
### 19 Swagger
A set of open-source tools built to help programmers develop design document and use REST apis.
