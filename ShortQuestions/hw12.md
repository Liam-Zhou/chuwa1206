## what is selenium?

It provides a way for developers to write scripts in various programming languages (such as Java, Python, C#, Ruby, and others) to automate interactions with web browsers. Selenium is commonly used for testing web applications, but it can also be employed for various other tasks, such as web scraping and automating repetitive tasks on websites.

## what is cucumber?

Cucumber is an open-source testing tool that facilitates behavior-driven development (BDD). It allows collaboration between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders in the software development process. Cucumber supports various programming languages, including Java, Ruby, Python, and others, making it versatile and accessible to teams using different technologies.

## what is JMeter?

Apache JMeter is an open-source Java-based desktop application designed to load test and measure the performance of web applications. It is widely used for simulating a heavy load on a server, network, or object to test its strength and performance under various conditions. JMeter is maintained by the Apache Software Foundation and provides a user-friendly graphical interface, making it accessible to both developers and non-technical users.

## What is the lifecircle of Junit?

Test Instance Creation:

1. Constructor or Factory Method: JUnit 5 allows a test instance to be created using either a no-argument constructor or a factory method annotated with @TestInstance at the class level.

2. Extension Initialization:

@BeforeEach: Methods annotated with @BeforeEach are executed before each test method. It is used for setting up common preconditions for each test method.
@AfterEach: Methods annotated with @AfterEach are executed after each test method. It is used for cleaning up resources or resetting state.

3. Test Execution: Test Methods, Actual test methods are executed.

4. Extension Cleanup:

@BeforeAll: Methods annotated with @BeforeAll are executed once before any test methods in the test class. It is used for setup activities that are shared among all test methods.
@AfterAll: Methods annotated with @AfterAll are executed once after all test methods in the test class have run. It is used for cleanup activities that are shared among all test methods.

## Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?

Yes, the @BeforeAll annotation is used for methods that should be executed once before all test methods in a test class. These methods must be static, and they cannot be instance methods.

## What is Mockito? and what is its limitations? what kind of tools can give help?

Mockito is a popular open-source Java framework used for creating and working with mock objects in unit testing. Mock objects are objects that simulate the behavior of real objects for testing purposes. Mockito simplifies the process of creating and using mock objects, allowing developers to isolate and test individual components of their code.

Limitations:

1. Final Classes and Methods: Mockito cannot mock final classes or methods. If you need to mock a final class or method, you may need to resort to other techniques or tools.

2. Static Methods: Mockito does not support mocking static methods. If your code relies heavily on static methods, other mocking frameworks or techniques may be more suitable.

3. Partial Mocking of Concrete Classes: While Mockito can mock interfaces and abstract classes, partial mocking of concrete classes can be challenging. Other tools, like PowerMock, may be used for this purpose.


## What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?

The @Mock annotation is used to create a mock object of a class or interface. Mock objects simulate the behavior of real objects but do not perform actual operations. Instead, they allow developers to define the behavior of specific methods and verify interactions during testing.

The @InjectMocks annotation is used to inject mock objects into the fields of a tested object. This is useful when you want to inject mocked dependencies into the class you are testing.

## What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?

Stubbing in the context of testing refers to the process of defining behaviors for methods of a mock object. When you create a mock object, it initially has no predefined behavior. Stubbing allows you to specify what the mock object should do when specific methods are called on it during the test.

## what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers?

Mockito ArgumentMatchers are a set of utilities provided by the Mockito framework to match arguments passed to mock objects during method invocations. They allow you to define flexible and expressive argument matching conditions when stubbing or verifying method calls on mock objects.

## what is Hamcrest Matchers?

Hamcrest Matchers allow developers to create flexible and readable assertions by chaining together various matchers to express the expected conditions. Hamcrest matchers are designed to read like natural language, making tests more descriptive and easier to understand.

## do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?

@Mock is used to create a mock object of a class or interface. The mock object is completely empty, and its methods don't have any predefined behavior. You typically use @Mock when you want to replace a real object with a simulated version that doesn't execute the actual code.

@Spy is used to create a spy object, which is a partial mock of a real object.
The spy retains the original behavior of the real object for methods that are not explicitly stubbed, and you can choose to mock specific methods while leaving others to execute their real implementation.

## What is assertion?

An assertion, in the context of software testing, is a statement or expression that checks whether a given condition or expected behavior holds true. It is a fundamental concept in testing and is used to validate that the actual outcome of a test matches the expected result. Assertions play a crucial role in ensuring the correctness and reliability of software by verifying that the code behaves as intended.

## If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of tests?

Unit Tests:
Purpose: Verify the correctness of individual units (functions, methods, or classes) in isolation.
Scope: Test the smallest components of the feature independently, mocking or stubbing external dependencies.
Benefits: Quickly identify and fix defects at the unit level. Facilitates code maintainability and modularity.

Integration Tests:
Purpose: Check the interaction and collaboration of multiple units or components to ensure they work together as expected.
Scope: Test the integration points between different units or modules.
Benefits: Detect issues arising from the combination of components. Validate the overall functionality of the feature.

Functional Tests: 
Purpose: Validate that the feature behaves as expected from an end-user perspective.
Scope: Test the entire functionality of the feature, often involving multiple units or components.
Benefits: Ensure that the feature meets the specified requirements and user expectations. Identify high-level issues.

End-to-End (E2E) Tests:
Purpose: Test the entire application or a substantial portion of it, simulating user interactions.
Scope: Mimic user journeys through the application, covering multiple features.
Benefits: Verify the integration of different parts of the application. Ensure the correct functioning of the application as a whole.
Regression Tests:

Purpose: Ensure that the new feature does not introduce regressions or unintended side effects in existing functionality.
Scope: Focus on critical paths and features affected by recent changes.
