10. When to use Spring Batch?

    We use spring batch when we need to process a large volume of data

11. How Spring Batch works?

    The JobLauncher starts a job, and the JobRepository stores the metadata for restartability. A job is composed ob steps, and each step has its own ItemReader, ItemProcessor, and ItemWriter. ItemReader is for fetching the data, ItemProcessor is for transforming the data, and ItemWriter is for persisting processed data into database.

12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?

    We can use Spring Task to schedule a spring batch job.

13. What is the cron expression?

    Seconds, Minutes, Hours, DayOfMonth, Month, DayOfWeek

14. What is the spring task?

    Spring Task is to execute scheduled task, cron

15. When to use Spring task?

    We use Spring Task when we need to schedule tasks

16. What is Filter and any filter example?

    Filter is a java class that is executed for each incoming request and outgoing response. It is a perfect place to put logic that will be performed on requests before they reaches Spring framework and on responses before they reaches clients.

    We could use filter to implement logging of HTTP requests and responses.

17. What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?

    Interceptor is at the controller level, and it performs operations on each request and response.

    We can intercept requests and process them with interceptor.

18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?

    preHandle is called before handler is called. If it returns false, the execution of a request is stopped. postHandle is called after the handler is executed. It then modifies the result of controller.

19. What is Swagger?

    Swagger is used to generate the REST API documents for RESTful web services.
