## HW12

#### What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that allows developers to modularize cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, security, and transaction management. A cross-cutting concern is a concern that affects multiple modules or components in an application.

####  What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
##### Advantages:
`Modularity`: AOP helps in achieving modularity by separating cross-cutting concerns from the core business logic.
`Code Reusability`: Aspects can be reused across different modules, promoting code reusability.
`Improved Readability`: The core business logic remains clean and focused, making the code more readable and maintainable.
`Separation of Concerns`: AOP enables the separation of cross-cutting concerns from the main business logic.

##### Disdvantages:
`Complexity`: AOP can introduce complexity, especially for developers unfamiliar with the concepts of aspects, pointcuts, and advice.
`Performance Overhead`: Depending on the implementation, there might be a slight performance overhead associated with the dynamic weaving of aspects.

####  What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
An aspect is a module that encapsulates cross-cutting concerns. It contains advice and may also include pointcuts and other configurations.

#### What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
A pointcut defines a set of join points. 

#### What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
A join point is a point in the execution of the program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception. Join points are the points where an aspect can be applied.
5.  What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?

####  When to use Spring Batch?
Spring Batch is particularly well-suited for scenarios involving the processing of large volumes of data in a batch-oriented manner. 
Examples:
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Processes

#### How Spring Batch works?
- Set up steps, e.g read data, process data, write the process data
- Define job, which represents a unit of work that needs to be executed. A job consists of one or more steps.
  
#### How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
Integrate with Spring's scheduling capabilities to create cron jobs.
    
#### What is the cron expression?
A cron expression is a string representing a schedule. It consists of fields that define when a job or task should run, such as minutes, hours, days, etc.

#### What is the spring task?
Spring Task is a feature that allows scheduling tasks in a Spring application. It is used for executing recurring tasks, similar to cron jobs.

#### When to use Spring task? 
When we need the task to run periodically

#### What is Filter and any filter example?
A Filter is a Java class used in web applications to perform filtering tasks, such as logging, authentication, or modifying request/response.

####  What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
An Interceptor is a Spring MVC feature that allows pre-processing and post-processing of web requests. It intercepts the execution of controller methods.

#### In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
`preHandle` is a method called before the actual handler method is executed. The `postHandle` method is called after the execution of the handler method but before the view is rendered.
    
#### What is Swagger?
Swagger is a tool for API documentation. It allows developers to design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services. Swagger UI provides an interactive interface for exploring APIs.
