#### 1.generic

Generic in Java is a feature that allows you to write code that is parameterized by types. These types include classes, interfaces and methods. This enable us to create more generalized code and reuse it withy different data types.

#### 5.Singleton, eagle and lazy load

Lazy loading:

```java
public class Singleton{
	private static volatile Singleton instance;
	private Singleton() {}
	
	public static Singleton getInstance() {
		if(instance == null){
			synchronized (Singleton.class) {
				if(instance == null)
					instance = new Singleton();
			}
		}
		return instance;
	}
	
}
```

Eager loading:

```java
public class Singleton{
  private static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();
  private Singleton() {}
  public static Singleton getInstance() {
    return instance;
  }
}
```

#### 6.RuntimeException

a `RuntimeException` is a subclass of `Exception` that indicates exceptions that may occur during the execution of a program but are not checked by the compiler.

Example: NullPointerException, ArithmeticException

#### 7.NullPointerException

It happens when you want to use an object reference which is null.

```
String k=null;
System.out.println(k.length()); // cause NPE
```

#### 8.Optional

The `Optional` class in Java is a container object which may or may not contain a non-null value. It's a means to avoid `NullPointerException`.It can improve the readability of your code by providing a clear and explicit way to deal with the absence of values.

#### 9.Advantage of Optional

1.It can avoid NullPointerException.

2.It can improve code readability.

3.It supports various methods for functional-style operations, like map, filter, and flatMap, which can be chained.

#### 10.Functional Interface

The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation in Java is used to indicate that an interface is intended to be a functional interface. Introduced in Java 8, a functional interface is an interface that has exactly one abstract method. These interfaces are used as the basis for lambda expressions in Java's functional programming features.

#### 11.Lambda

A lambda expression in Java is a concise way to represent an anonymous function that can be passed around. It was introduced in Java 8 as part of Java's inclusion of functional programming features. Lambda expressions allow you to express instances of single-method interfaces (functional interfaces) more compactly.

#### 12.method reference

Method references in Java are a feature introduced in Java 8 that allow you to refer to methods or constructors of a class in a concise way. They are a type of syntactic sugar for lambda expressions where the lambda body consists of a single method call. Method references make your code cleaner and more readable.

#### 13.Java 8 new features

1.Lambda

2.Stream API

3.Method reference

4.Optional

5.Default Methods for interfaces

6.new Functional Interfaces

#### 14.Lambda use unchanged var outside, detail?

Lambda expressions can use final variables or effectively final(never changed after initial) variables from the enclosing scope. But it cannot modify these variables in the enclosing scope.

#### 16.Can a functional interface extend/inherit another interface?

Yes. But it must maintain Functional interface's property: has exactly one abstract function.

#### 17.

The lambda expression implements the single abstract method of the functional interface.

#### 19.String::Valueof

it is a method reference. Method references are a shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method. In the case of `String::valueOf`, it refers to the `valueOf` method of the `String` class.

#### 20.Intermediate and Terminal operations

Intermediate operations are operations that transform a stream into another stream. They are lazy, meaning they do not start processing the data until a terminal operation is invoked. Each intermediate operation yields a new stream as its result. These operations are often chained to form a pipeline of operations.

Terminal operations are operations that produce a result or a side-effect. Once a terminal operation is performed, the stream pipeline is considered consumed and can no longer be used. Terminal operations trigger the processing of the data in the stream pipeline and produce either a side-effect or return a result.

#### 21.common Intermediate operations

Map, filter, sorted, distinct, limit, skip

#### 22.

findFirst: find the first element in the stream

findAny: find any elemnent in the stream

#### 23.

Collections in Java (like `List`, `Set`, `Map`, etc., from the `java.util` package) are primarily about storing and accessing data. They are in-memory data structures that hold elements, allowing you to add, remove, update, and retrieve elements.

Streams (introduced in Java 8) are a sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations. They are not data structures but convey elements from a source (like a collection) through a pipeline of computational steps.
