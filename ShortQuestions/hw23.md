##### 1. What is generic in Java? and type the generic code by yourself.

A generic type is a generic class or interface that is parameterized over types.

##### 5. Write the Singleton design pattern include eager load and lazy load.

```java
public class EagerSingleton {
    private static final EagerSingleton instance=new EagerSingleton();

    private EagerSingleton(){}

    public static EagerSingleton getInstance(){
        return instance;
    }
}
```

```java
public class ThreadSafeSingleton {
    private static final class ThreadSafeHolder{
        private static final ThreadSafeSingleton holder=new ThreadSafeSingleton();
    }

    private ThreadSafeSingleton(){}

    public ThreadSafeSingleton getInstance(){
        return ThreadSafeHolder.holder;
    }
}
```



##### 6. What is Runtime Exception? could you give me some examples?

Runtime Exception is catched during runtime.

- ArithmeticException
- NullPointerException

##### 7. Could you give me one example of NullPointerException?

```java
String a=null;
a.equals("b"); //NullPointerException
```



##### 8. What is the Optional class?

Optional is a container object which may or may not contain a non-null value.

##### 9. What are the advantages of using the Optional class?

Avoiding nested null checking. As a result, we'll be able to chain method calls and have more fluent, functional code.

##### 10. What is the @FunctionalInterface?

An annotation for sanity test, indicating that an interface should be functional interface.

##### 11. what is lamda?

Lambda expression is a grammar sugar for implementing SAM interface, in the form of arrow function. It's a tool of functional programming.

##### 12. What is Method Reference?

Method references are a special type of lambda expressions. Theyâ€™re often used to create simple lambda expressions by referencing existing methods.

##### 13. What is Java 8 new features?

- Default method and static method in interface
- Lambda expression
- Functional interface
- Method reference
- Optional
- Stream
- CompletableFuture

##### 14. Lambda can use unchanged variable outside of lambda? what is the details?

Lambda expression can use variables that are final or effectively final outside of lambda. Effectively final means the address of variable doesn't change within the variable's scope.

##### 15. Describe the newly added features in Java 8?

See Q13

##### 16. Can a functional interface extend/inherit another interface?

Yes, it can.

##### 17. What is the lambda expression in Java and How does a lambda expression relate to a functional interface?

Lambda expression in Java is a grammar sugar for implementing SAM interface, in the form of arrow function. It's a tool of functional programming.

A lambda expression will be compiled to a anonymous inner class which implements a functional interface.

##### 18. In Java 8, what is Method Reference?

see Q12

##### 19. What does the String::ValueOf expression mean?

It refers to the method ValueOf In the String Class.

##### 20. What are Intermediate and Terminal operations?

Intermediate Operations

- Methods are chained together.
- Intermediate operations transform a stream into another stream.
- It enables the concept of filtering where one method filters data and passes it to another method after processing.

Terminal Operations

Terminal Operations are the type of Operations that return the result. These Operations are not processed further and just return a final result value.

##### 21. What are the most commonly used Intermediate operations?

- map
- filter
- sorted

##### 22. What is the difference between findFirst() and findAny()?

In parallel mode the `findAny` does not guaranteed order, but the `findFirst` guarantees the first element will be returned.

##### 23. How are Collections different from Stream?

- Stream doesn't store data
- Stream operations doesm't change the original data
- Stream can be traversed only once
- Stream cannot be randomly accessed
