3. **What is Aspect Oriented Programming?** Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) complements Object-Oriented Programming by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns (aspects), such as logging and transaction management, from the business logic of the program.

4. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?** Advantages include modularization of cross-cutting concerns, improved code readability, and reduced code duplication. Disadvantages might involve a learning curve, potential performance overhead, and complexity in debugging.
5. **What is Aspect in Spring AOP?** An Aspect is a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes, like transaction management. Aspects can declare advice (action taken at a join point) and pointcuts (where advice is applied).
6. **What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?** A Pointcut is an expression that selects one or more join points. It's used to determine where advice should be applied within your application.
7. **What is the Join point in Spring AOP?** A Join point represents a point in the execution of the program, such as method execution or exception handling, where behavior can be changed or enhanced.
8. **What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?** Advice defines the action taken at a join point and can be one of several types, including before, after, after-returning, after-throwing, and around.
9. **When to use Spring Batch?** Use Spring Batch for processing large volumes of data, complex batch processing where data needs to be processed in stages, and for high-volume, low-latency tasks.
10. **How Spring Batch works?** Spring Batch provides a framework for processing large volumes of data in batch jobs. It follows a standard pattern of reading data, processing it, and then writing it.
11. **How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?** Scheduling a Spring Batch job can be done using Spring's task scheduling support, such as the `@Scheduled` annotation, or integration with external schedulers like Quartz.
12. **What is the cron expression?** A cron expression is a string representing a schedule in a time-based job-scheduling format. It specifies the timing for running tasks in Unix-based systems and is used in applications like Spring Batch for scheduling.
13. **What is the spring task?** Spring Task is an abstraction for task execution and scheduling. It simplifies the execution and scheduling of asynchronous tasks.
14. **When to use Spring task?** Use Spring Task for asynchronous execution and scheduling of tasks that do not require the robust features of a full-fledged batch processing system.
15. **What is Filter and any filter example?** A Filter is used for intercepting requests and responses in a web application. Example: a logging filter that logs request details before passing the request along the filter chain.
16. **What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?** An Interceptor allows you to intercept and manipulate requests and responses in your application. It can be used for logging, authentication, auditing, and performance monitoring.
17. **In Interceptor What is preHandle? What is postHandle?** `preHandle` is called before the actual handler is executed. `postHandle` is called after the handler execution, allowing for additional processing before the response is sent to the client.
18. **What is Swagger?** Swagger is an open-source tool used for designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful web services. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the API's endpoints.
