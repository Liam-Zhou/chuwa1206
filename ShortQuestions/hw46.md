## 3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) complements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns (aspects), such as logging, transaction management, or security, from the business logic of the program. AOP introduces the concept of aspects, join points, advice, pointcuts, and weaving to modularize common concerns across multiple types or objects.

## 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
Advantages:

Modularity: Enhances modularity by separating cross-cutting concerns from the business logic.
Reusability: Allows for the reuse of aspects across different parts of the application.
Pluggability: Facilitates the easy addition or removal of concerns like logging or transaction management without touching the core business logic.
Improved Code Maintainability: Reduces code duplication and improves maintainability.

Disadvantages:

Complexity: Can add complexity to the configuration and understanding of the application.
Performance Overhead: May introduce a slight performance overhead due to the aspect weaving process.
Limited to Method Execution: Primarily supports method execution join points, limiting its applicability in some scenarios.

## 5. What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
An Aspect is a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes. It is the unit of modularity in AOP, encapsulating behaviors that affect multiple classes into reusable modules. In Spring AOP, aspects are implemented using regular classes annotated with @Aspect or XML configuration.

## 6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
A Pointcut is a predicate that matches join points. It is used to determine where advice should be applied within our application. In Spring AOP, pointcuts help to specify the execution points of advice, such as method execution or object initialization.

## 7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
A Join point represents a point in the execution of the application where an aspect can be plugged in. This includes method calls, method execution, and object instantiation. In Spring AOP, a join point is conceptually always the execution of a method.

## 8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
Advice defines the action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. Different types of advice include:
Before: Advice that runs before the join point but does not have the ability to prevent execution flow unless it throws an exception.
After Returning: Advice to be executed after a method returns normally.
After Throwing: Advice to be executed if a method exits by throwing an exception.
After (finally): Advice to be executed regardless of the method exit, whether normally or exceptionally.
Around: The most powerful advice, it surrounds a join point such as a method invocation. This advice can control whether to proceed to the join point or to shortcut the advised method execution by returning its own return value or throwing an exception.

## 10. When to use Spring Batch?
Spring Batch is used for processing large volumes of data in batch jobs, ideal for scenarios like data migration, file processing, and scheduled tasks that involve processing high volumes of data with reliability and performance in mind.

## 11. How Spring Batch works?
Spring Batch works by reading data from a resource (e.g., database, file), processing it, and then writing it to another resource. It follows a chunk-oriented processing pattern where transactions are bounded around chunks of data, providing scalability and fault tolerance for batch processing.

## 12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
A Spring Batch Job can be scheduled using Spring's task scheduling capabilities, such as @Scheduled annotation or Spring's TaskScheduler interface, often in combination with cron expressions to define execution schedules.

## 13. What is the cron expression?
A cron expression is a string representing a schedule in a time-based job scheduling format. It consists of six or seven fields, representing second, minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week, and optionally, year, allowing for precise scheduling patterns.

## 14. What is the spring task?
Spring Task is an abstraction for task execution and scheduling built into the Spring Framework. It provides annotations and interfaces for asynchronous execution and scheduling of tasks.

## 15. When to use Spring task? 
Spring Task is used when we need to execute asynchronous tasks or schedule jobs to run at specific times without needing the full capabilities of Spring Batch. It's suitable for light to medium lifting in terms of background processing.

## 16. What is Filter and any filter example?
A Filter is an object used to intercept HTTP requests and responses in a web application. It can perform filtering tasks, such as logging, authentication, and input validation.
```java
@WebFilter(urlPatterns = "/*")
public class LogFilter implements Filter {
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response,
```
## 17. What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
An Interceptor is similar to a Filter, but it's part of Spring MVC and allows for more fine-grained control over the handling of HTTP requests and responses. Interceptors can perform operations before and after the execution of a request handler.
Use cases: logging, authentication, validation, and transaction management.

## 18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
preHandle(): Called before the actual handler is executed; can be used to perform operations before sending the request to the controller.
postHandle(): Called after the handler method is executed; can be used to perform operations before sending the response to the client.

## 19. What is Swagger?
Swagger is an open-source software framework backed by a large ecosystem of tools that helps developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services. It provides a web-based UI that allows for easy testing and interaction with web services, documentation generation, and client SDK generation from an API specification.
