3.  What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
    Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) complements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns (aspects), such as logging, transaction management, and security from the business logic of the program.
4.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
    Advantages:
    Separation of concerns, which leads to better modularity.
    More readable and maintainable code.
    Reduced code duplication.
    Disadvantages:
    Can be complex to understand and implement.
    May introduce overhead at runtime.
    Debugging can be more difficult due to the dynamic nature of AOP.
5.  What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
    An Aspect is a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes. It is a class that encapsulates the behavior that you want to apply across various modules of your application.
6.  What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
    A Pointcut is a set of one or more join points where an advice should be executed. It can be thought of as a query that matches join points.
7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
   A Join point is a point during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception, where behavior can be changed.
8.  What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
    Advice is an action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. Types of advice include "before", "after", "after-returning", "after-throwing", and "around".
10. When to use Spring Batch?
    Use Spring Batch for processing large volumes of data, complex batch jobs, and for situations requiring reliable and transactional processing.
11. How Spring Batch works
    Spring Batch provides a framework for processing large volumes of data in batch jobs. It follows a standard batch architecture where a job repository keeps track of the metadata and a sequence of steps each processing a chunk of data.
12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
    We can schedule Spring Batch jobs using task scheduling abstractions such as @Scheduled annotation, or by integrating with scheduling frameworks like Quartz.
13. What is the cron expression?
    A cron expression is a string representing a schedule in a time-based job-scheduling format used by Unix systems. It defines when a task should happen.
14. What is the spring task?
    Spring Task is an abstraction for scheduling tasks with a specified execution policy, such as fixed-rate or cron-based triggers.
15. When to use Spring task?
    Use Spring Task for asynchronous execution and scheduling of tasks without needing a full-blown enterprise solution like Quartz.
16. What is Filter and any filter example?
    A Filter is a reusable code segment that can transform the request and response of a server. An example could be a logging filter that logs all requests.
17.  What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
     An Interceptor is similar to a Filter, but it's often used with Spring MVC where it can intercept web requests and responses. We can use interceptors for tasks like logging, authentication, and authorization.
18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
    preHandle is called before the actual handler is executed. postHandle is called after the handler returns but before the view is rendered.
19. What is Swagger?
Swagger is a set of tools for designing, building, documenting, and using RESTful web services. It allows you to describe the structure of your APIs so that machines can read them. The ability of APIs to describe their own structure is the root of all the goodness that Swagger offers. Key features include:
Swagger Editor: Browser-based editor where you can write OpenAPI specs.
Swagger UI: Renders OpenAPI specs as interactive API documentation.
Swagger Codegen: Generates server stubs and client libraries from an OpenAPI spec.
