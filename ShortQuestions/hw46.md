### Q3
AOP is a programming approach that separates cross-cutting concerns(eg, logging or security) from main business logic, using aspects to add behavior to code w/o directly modifying it, resulting in more modular and maintainable code
### Q4
- pros
  - modularity: separates cross-butting concerns from business logic
  - maintainability: makes the codebase cleaner and more maintainable
- cons
  - performance overhead: can introduce latency, especially in fine-grained pointcuts
  - complexity: the abstraction and configuration can be complex for beginners
### Q5
An Aspect is a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes, such as transaction management or logging. It's typically a class annotated with `@Aspect`, combining pointcuts and advices
### Q6
A Pointcut is a set of criteria used to identify join points (specific points in the program execution) where advice should be applied, effectively defining "where" the aspect code will be executed
### Q7
A Join point represents a specific point in the execution of a program, such as method execution or exception handling, where an aspect can be applied
### Q8
`Advice` refers to the action taken by an aspect at a particular join point
- before: before join point
- after returning: executes after a join point completes normally
- after throwing: triggered if a method exits by throwing an exception
- after(finally): executes after a join point, regardless of its outcome
- around: surrounds a join point, allowing control over the original method execution
### Q10
processing large volumes of data, complex processing flows with steps and decision logic. Batch jobs that require robustness and reliability
### Q11
- defining jobs composed of steps
- each step involves reading data, processing it, and writing the processed data
- job execution is managed, allowing restart/retry capabilities
### Q12
- use scheduling frameworks `@Scheduled` annotation in spring
- define a task to run the job at specified intervals or times
### Q13
it is a string representing a schedule in a time-based job scheduling format. It comprises 6/7 fields specifying time intervals like seconds, minutes, hours, day-of-month, month, day-of-week, year, used in schedulers like cron
### Q14
- it refers to spring framework's support for asynchronous execution and scheduling of tasks
- `@Async`: for executing methods asynchronously
- `@Scheduled`: for scheduling tasks at fixed rates or cron expression
- `task executors`: for managing thread pool and task execution
### Q15
- for asynchronous method execution
- for scheduling regular tasks
### Q16
A filter in web applications is a reusable code segment that processes requests/responses before/after they reach a servlet
### Q17
- It's a component that intercepts requests and responses in the application's workflow
- logging
- authentication and authorization
- performance monitoring
- data transformation or validation
### Q18
- preHandle: method called before the actual handler is executed; can be used to perform operations like authentication checks
- postHandle: method called after handler is executed but before the view is rendered; can be used for additional processing / adding attributes to the model
### Q19
It is a set of tools for designing, building, documenting and consuming RESTful web services. it provides a framework for API development with a user-friendly interface, enabling easy API documentation and visualization
