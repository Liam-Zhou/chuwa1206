3. **What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?**
   Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. It does so by adding additional behavior to existing code without modifying the code itself.

4. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?**
    - Advantages: Simplifies code by separating cross-cutting concerns, promotes code reuse, and improves maintainability.
    - Disadvantages: Can make the flow of execution harder to follow, and there might be a slight performance overhead.

5. **What is Aspect in Spring AOP?**
   In Spring AOP, an aspect is a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes, such as transaction management. Aspects can contain advice (code joined to specified points in the application) and inter-type declarations.

6. **What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?**
   A pointcut in Spring AOP is an expression that matches join points (method execution points) in Spring beans, serving as a way to determine where advice should be applied.

7. **What is the Join point in Spring AOP?**
   A join point in Spring AOP represents a point in an application where an aspect can be applied, such as method execution, exception handling, or field modification.

8. **What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?**
   Advice in Spring AOP refers to the action taken by an aspect at a specific join point. Types include `Before`, `After Returning`, `After Throwing`, `After`, and `Around`.

10. **When to use Spring Batch?**
    Spring Batch is used for processing large volumes of data, complex batch processing scenarios, and for tasks that require reliable and secure processing, often found in enterprise-level applications.

11. **How Spring Batch works?**
    Spring Batch works by reading data from a source, processing it, and then writing it to a destination. It provides mechanisms for transaction management, chunk processing, and resource management.

12. **How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?**
    A Spring Batch job can be scheduled using scheduling frameworks like Quartz or Spring's own task scheduling.

13. **What is the cron expression?**
    A cron expression is a string representing a schedule in a time-based job-scheduling format. It consists of fields representing different time units like seconds, minutes, hours, etc.

14. **What is the spring task?**
    Spring Task refers to Spring's task execution and scheduling framework, which allows for the execution of asynchronous tasks and the scheduling of tasks.

15. **When to use Spring task?**
    Use Spring Task for asynchronous execution of methods and for scheduling tasks to be executed periodically or at a specific time.

16. **What is Filter and any filter example?**
    A filter in Java is an object that performs filtering tasks on either the request to a resource, or on the response from a resource. Example: `HttpServletFilter` to log request details.

17. **What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?**
    An interceptor in Spring is used to intercept requests and responses in an application. It can be used for logging, authentication, auditing, etc.

18. **In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?**
    - `preHandle`: Called before the actual handler is executed.
    - `postHandle`: Called after the handler method is invoked.

19. **What is Swagger?**
    Swagger is a set of tools for designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful web services. It includes specifications and a suite of tools to implement those specifications.
