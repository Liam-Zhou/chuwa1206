1. what is selenium?

   - elenium is an open-source framework for automating web applications. It provides a way to interact with web browsers programmatically, allowing developers and testers to automate various tasks, including testing, browser interaction, and web scraping. 

2. what is cucumber?

   - Cucumber is an open-source testing tool that supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It allows collaboration among developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders by using natural language specifications that are written in a format called Gherkin. Cucumber facilitates the creation of executable specifications, which serve as living documentation for software behavior.

3. what is JMeter?

   - JMeter is an open-source software that is used to test the performance and functional behavior of various applications and protocols, such as Web, SOAP, FTP, LDAP, etc. It was originally designed for testing web applications but has since expanded to other test functions

4. What is the lifecircle of Junit?

   - **Test Class Initialization (`@BeforeClass`)**
   - **Test Method Initialization (`@Before`)**
   - **Test Method Execution (`@Test`)**
   - **Test Method Cleanup (`@After`)**
   - **Repeat Steps 2-4 for each test method**
   - **Test Class Cleanup (`@AfterClass`)**

5. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?

   - Yes, in JUnit 5, the `@BeforeAll` annotation is used for methods that should be executed once before any of the test methods in the test class. For this reason, the method annotated with `@BeforeAll` must be a static method at the class level.

     - import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll;
       import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

       public class MyTestClass {

           @BeforeAll
           static void setUpClass() {
               // Initialization code for the entire test class
           }
           
           @Test
           void testMethod1() {
               // Test logic for method 1
           }
           
           @Test
           void testMethod2() {
               // Test logic for method 2
           }
           

6. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations? what kind of tools can give help?

   - Mockito is a popular open-source mocking framework for Java that allows developers to create and use mock objects in unit tests. Mock objects simulate the behavior of real objects within a controlled environment, enabling developers to isolate and test specific components of their code without relying on the actual implementation of dependent objects.
   - Limitation:
     - **Cannot Mock Final Classes and Methods:**
       - Mockito cannot mock final classes or methods. If a class or method is declared as final, Mockito won't be able to create a mock object for it.
     - **Limited Support for Static and Private Methods:**
       - Mockito has limited support for mocking static methods and private methods. Mockito cannot directly mock static methods, and it cannot mock private methods unless they are in a package-private class.
     - **Overuse of Mocking Can Lead to Fragile Tests:**
       - Overuse of mocking, especially when mocking too many details of the system under test, can lead to tests that are tightly coupled to the implementation details. This may make tests fragile and prone to break when the implementation changes.
     - **Not Suitable for All Types of Testing:**
       - While Mockito is excellent for unit testing and creating isolated test scenarios, it may not be suitable for all types of testing, such as integration testing or testing interactions with external systems.
   - Tools:
     - **PowerMock:** A framework that extends Mockito and provides additional capabilities, including the ability to mock final classes, static methods, and private methods.
     - **Spock:** A testing and specification framework for Java and Groovy that provides a powerful and expressive testing DSL (Domain-Specific Language). Spock supports mocking and stubbing similar to Mockito.
     - **JUnit 5 with Extensions:** JUnit 5, in combination with extensions like `MockitoExtension` or other testing extensions, can be used to enhance testing capabilities.
     - **TestNG:** An alternative testing framework that also supports mocking through tools like Mockito.

7. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?

   - **@Mock:**
     - The `@Mock` annotation is used to create a mock object for a class or interface. It tells Mockito to create a mock instance of the specified class or interface, and you can use this mock object to define the behavior of methods, set expectations, and perform verifications in your tests.
   - **@InjectMocks:**
     - The `@InjectMocks` annotation is used to inject mocks into the fields of a tested object (the object under test). It is typically applied to fields of a test class, and Mockito will automatically inject the mocks annotated with `@Mock` into the corresponding fields of the test class.

8. What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?

   - Stubbing, in the context of testing and specifically in the context of mocking frameworks like Mockito, refers to the process of defining behaviors for mock objects. When you stub a method, you are specifying what the method should return or do when it is called during a test. This is done to simulate the behavior of real objects and control the interactions in a test scenario.

     In Mockito, stubbing is achieved using the `when()` method, which is part of the `Mockito` class. The `when()` method is typically used in conjunction with methods like `thenReturn()`, `thenThrow()`, or other methods that define the behavior of the mock object.

9. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers

   - `ArgumentMatchers` is a utility class that provides a set of methods for creating flexible and expressive argument matchers when defining behaviors for mock objects. Argument matchers are used in conjunction with Mockito's stubbing and verification mechanisms to specify conditions on the method arguments.

10. what is Hamcrest Matchers

    - Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects in Java. Matchers are used to create flexible and readable assertions or conditions in tests. Hamcrest provides a set of matchers that can be combined to express complex conditions in a more natural and expressive way.
    - Matchers in Hamcrest are often used in conjunction with testing frameworks like JUnit or TestNG, as well as libraries like Mockito. The primary goal of Hamcrest is to make the test code more readable and to provide a more fluent and descriptive style for writing assertions.

11. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?

    - **@Mock:**
      - The `@Mock` annotation is used to create a mock object. Mock objects simulate the behavior of real objects, and their methods return default values (e.g., `null` for objects, `0` for numbers) unless stubbed otherwise. With `@Mock`, you typically create a completely new mock object.
    - **@Spy:**
      - The `@Spy` annotation, on the other hand, is used to create a spy object. A spy is a partial mock that allows you to retain the real implementation of the methods of the object being spied on unless explicitly stubbed. This means that the real methods are invoked unless you specify otherwise, and you can use the spy to partially mock a real object.

12. What is assertion?

    - An assertion, in the context of software testing, is a statement or expression that checks whether a given condition or expected behavior is true during the execution of a program. Assertions are fundamental in testing because they help verify that the actual outcomes match the expected outcomes.

13. If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of tests?

    - When developing a new feature, a comprehensive testing strategy typically involves various types of tests, each serving a specific purpose in ensuring the quality and correctness of the implemented functionality. The following are common types of tests that can be written for a new feature:
      1. **Unit Tests:**
         - **Purpose:** Verify the correctness of individual units or components of the feature in isolation. Units are usually small functions, methods, or classes.
         - **Scope:** Focus on testing the smallest parts of the code, such as functions or methods, with no external dependencies.
      2. **Integration Tests:**
         - **Purpose:** Validate the interactions and collaborations between different components or units of the feature. Ensure that these components work together as expected.
         - **Scope:** Test the integration points between modules, classes, or services, considering how they interact with each other.
      3. **Functional Tests:**
         - **Purpose:** Evaluate the feature's functionality from an end-to-end perspective. Verify that the feature works as intended when all components are integrated and interacting correctly.
         - **Scope:** Test the entire workflow or user journey of the feature, simulating real user interactions and input.
      4. **Regression Tests:**
         - **Purpose:** Ensure that the new feature does not introduce regressions or unintended side effects to existing functionality. Catch any issues that may arise when changes are made to the codebase.
         - **Scope:** Test both the new feature and critical existing functionality to detect potential conflicts.
      5. **Acceptance Tests:**
         - **Purpose:** Confirm that the new feature meets the acceptance criteria defined by stakeholders or product owners. Ensure that the feature aligns with the user's expectations and requirements.
         - **Scope:** Focus on high-level scenarios and user interactions to validate that the feature behaves as specified.
      6. **Performance Tests:**
         - **Purpose:** Evaluate the performance characteristics of the new feature, such as response times, scalability, and resource utilization.
         - **Scope:** Identify potential bottlenecks and assess how the feature performs under different conditions (e.g., varying loads or data volumes).
      7. **Security Tests:**
         - **Purpose:** Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in the feature. Ensure that the implementation adheres to security best practices.
         - **Scope:** Check for common security issues, such as input validation, authentication, authorization, and protection against common attacks.
      8. **Usability Tests:**
         - **Purpose:** Assess the user experience and usability aspects of the new feature. Evaluate how intuitive and user-friendly the feature is.
         - **Scope:** Involve actual users or testers to provide feedback on the user interface, interactions, and overall usability.
      9. **Exploratory Tests:**
         - **Purpose:** Encourage exploration and discovery of potential issues that may not be covered by predefined test cases. Leverage testers' creativity and experience to find unexpected problems.
         - **Scope:** Allow testers to explore the feature freely, providing feedback and reporting issues they encounter during exploration.
      10. **End-to-End Tests:**
          - **Purpose:** Validate the entire application or system with the new feature included. Ensure that the feature integrates seamlessly with other parts of the system.
          - **Scope:** Test the complete application workflow, including all components and external dependencies.
