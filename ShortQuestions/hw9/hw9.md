### Question 4:
JPA is a Java specification for accessing, managing, and persisting data between Java objects and relational databases. It provides a set of interfaces and annotations for developers to work with databases in a standardized way.

### Question 5:
HikariCP (Hikari Connection Pool) is a high-performance connection pool for JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) connections in Java applications.

### Question 6:
@OneToMany: Indicates a one-to-many relationship where one entity is related to multiple instances of another entity.
@ManyToOne: Indicates a many-to-one relationship where multiple instances of one entity are related to a single instance of another entity.
@ManyToMany: Indicates a many-to-many relationship where multiple instances of one entity are related to multiple instances of another entity.

### Question 7:
cascade = CascadeType.ALL specifies that all operations (e.g., persist, remove, merge) on the owning entity should be cascaded to the related entities.
orphanRemoval = true means that if an entity is removed from the collection of related entities, it should be deleted from the database.

### Question 8:
fetch = FetchType.LAZY loads related entities lazily, meaning they are fetched from the database only when accessed. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary data retrieval.
fetch = FetchType.EAGER loads related entities eagerly, meaning they are fetched along with the owning entity. This can lead to performance issues if there are many related entities.

### Question 9:
JPA uses naming conventions to generate SQL queries automatically. You can follow these conventions or implement methods manually.
Naming conventions include method names like findBy..., findBy...And..., deleteBy..., and more.



### Question 13:
JPQL is a query language defined by the Java Persistence API (JPA) for querying and manipulating data in a database using object-oriented syntax. JPQL is database-agnostic and allows developers to write queries based on the entity classes in their application rather than using SQL.


### Question 14:
@NamedQuery is an annotation in JPA that allows you to define named queries within an entity class. These named queries can be used to execute predefined JPQL queries.

### Question 15:
@Query is an annotation provided by JPA and is used to define custom JPQL or SQL queries directly in your repository interface.

### Question 16:
HQL is Hibernate's object-oriented query language, similar to JPQL. It allows developers to write queries using Hibernate-specific syntax. HQL is closely related to SQL and can be used to query and manipulate data in a database. Criteria Queries, on the other hand, are a type-safe and programmatic way to create queries using criteria builder objects.

### Question 17:
EntityManager is a key interface in JPA that is responsible for managing the lifecycle of entities, including persisting, merging, removing, and querying entities. It represents a runtime environment for working with JPA entities.

### Question 18:
In Hibernate, SessionFactory is a heavyweight, thread-safe, and immutable factory for creating Session instances.

### Question 19:
A transaction is a sequence of one or more database operations that are treated as a single, atomic unit of work.

### Question 20:
Hibernate Caching is a mechanism that allows Hibernate to store and reuse previously fetched data to improve application performance. 

### Question 21:
First-level cache is associated with a Hibernate Session object and is also known as the session-level cache. It stores the entities fetched or operated on within a single Hibernate session. The first-level cache is short-lived and exists only during the lifetime of the session.
Second-level cache is shared across multiple Hibernate sessions and allows data to be cached and reused across different sessions. The second-level cache is typically configured for entities or query results that need to be shared among multiple sessions, improving overall performance.

### Question 22:
The @Transactional annotation in Spring (and JPA) is used to define the scope of a transactional method. It signifies that the annotated method or all methods within the annotated class should be executed within a database transaction.
