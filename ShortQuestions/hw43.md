2. #### What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Springboot?

Spring is a powerful, light-weight Java Framework used for building java applications. 

Its features: DI, AOP, Data Access framework

Spring Boot is an extension of Spring framework, designed to simplify the bootstrapping and development of Spring applications. It provides a faster and easier way to set up, configure and run both simple and complex applications.

Features: auto-configuration, Opinionated defaults, no code generation

Benefits of using Spring Boot: Rapid and easy development. With auto-configuration and starter dependencies, Spring Boot makes it easy to start a new project and get it up and running quickly.

Reduce boilerplate code.  Large community and ecosystem.



3. #### What is IOC and What is DI?

IOC: inversion of control, the control of objects is transferred to the framework/container rather than the application code.

DI: Dependency Injection, is the implementation of IOC, the dependencies of an object is injected by the IOC container instead of created within the object.

DI reduces coupling between classes and increases the possibility of reusing these classes.

**IoC Container**: The Spring container is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling objects known as beans.

**DI in Spring**: Spring implements DI primarily through XML configuration or annotations. Objects define their dependencies, and the Spring container injects those dependencies when it creates the beans.

4. #### What is  @CompnonentScan?

`@ComponentScan` is an annotation used in the Spring Framework. It tells Spring where to look for annotated components/classes. By default, Spring scans for components in the same package as the class that declares the `@ComponentScan` annotation. However

5. #### How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?

To specify the packages to scan in an XML configuration file, you use the `<context:component-scan>` element.

With annotation-based configuration, you use the `@ComponentScan` annotation in a configuration class to specify the packages to scan.

6. #### What is  @SpringbootApplication?

@SpringbootApplication is an annotation in Spring Boot that includes three key annotations: @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, @ComponentScan. It's typically used in the main application class.

7. #### how many ways we can define a bean?

@bean, @Component, @Repository, @Service, @Controller, @RestController, @ControllerAdvice

XML configuration, 

8. #### What is default bean name for  @Component and  @Bean?

@Component:  class name

@Bean: method name

9. #### What is the difference between  @component and  @service,@repository?

   @Component is a generic stereotype for Spring-managed component. it's used when a class doesn't fit any specific role.

   @Service is used for the service layer, indicating that the class holds business logic.

   @Repository is used for data access layer, indicating that the class holds logic to access data sources.

#### 10.How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?

@Autowired, @Inject, @Resource(name="BeanName"), @Qualifier(qualifiy the injected bean when multiple candidates are present)

11. #### Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?

1.Constructor injection

2.Setter Injection

3.Field Injection

Constructor Injection is preferred. It ensures that required dependencies are not null. Constructor injection makes it clear which dependencies are necessary for the class to function properly. Helps in avoiding circular dependencies in the application.

12. #### If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.

In Spring, when you have multiple beans of the same type and you want to specify which one should be used by default, you can use the `@Primary` annotation. Additionally, if you want to instruct Spring to pick a specific bean where there's no primary bean defined, you can use the `@Qualifier` annotation. 

13. #### What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?

BeanFactory is a basic IOC container to manage and instantiate beans, while ApplicationContext has more features: AOP, event propogation, resource handling.

Beanfactory  uses lazy initializaton, but ApplicationContext uses eager initialization.

14. #### What is the Scope of a Bean?  and list the examples for each scope

1.Singleton: Only one instance of the bean is created for the Spring Container.       (A service that provides stateless operations)

2.Prototype: A new instance is created each time it is injected or retrieved from the container. (Beans that are stateful and unique to each consumer or request, such as data transfer objects.)

3.Request: A new bean instance is created for each HTTP request. This scope is valid only in the context of a web-aware Spring `ApplicationContext`.

4.Session: A single bean instance is created per HTTP session. This scope is also specific to web applications.

5.Application:  A single bean instance per `ServletContext`.

6.WebSocket:  A single bean instance per WebSocket connection. 

15. #### Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean?

```
<bean id="dataSource" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource">
    <property name="driverClassName" value="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver" />
    <property name="url" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb" />
    <property name="username" value="user" />
    <property name="password" value="pass" />
</bean>

<bean id="myRepository" class="com.example.MyRepository">
    <constructor-arg ref="dataSource" />
</bean>
```
