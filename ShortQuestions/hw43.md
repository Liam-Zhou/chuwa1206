2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?
   Spring is a comprehensive framework for building enterprise Java applications, with a focus on simplifying Java EE development. It provides extensive infrastructure support for developing applications, including data access, transaction management, MVC web applications, and more. Spring Boot is a project built on top of the Spring Framework. It simplifies the process of setting up and configuring Spring applications by providing conventions over configuration, thereby reducing development time and effort.

Benefits of Using Spring Boot:

Simplifies Spring application setup and configuration with sensible defaults.
Reduces the need for explicit configuration with auto-configuration.
Provides embedded Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow servers, eliminating the need for WAR files.
Offers a wide range of starter dependencies to simplify your build configuration.
Facilitates easy access to a wide range of Spring functionalities.
3.  What is IOC and What is DI?
    IOC is a design principle in which the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework. Dependency Injection is a design pattern that implements IOC, where objects are given their dependencies instead of creating them internally. DI allows for more modular code and improves the testability of a software component.
4.  What is  @CompnonentScan?
    This annotation is used with @Configuration classes. It tells Spring to search for Spring components, configurations, and services in the specified package(s), thereby allowing it to detect and register beans automatically.
5.  How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?
    XML: Use the <context:component-scan base-package="com.example.package" /> tag in your XML configuration file to specify the package to scan.
    Annotation: Use the @ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.package") annotation in your @Configuration class.
6.  What is  @SpringbootApplication?
    This is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:
@Configuration: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions.
@EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.
@ComponentScan: Enables @Component scan on the package where the application is located.
7. How many ways wo can define a bean?
   Beans can be defined in multiple ways in Spring:

Using @Bean annotation in a @Configuration class.
Declaring a component class with @Component, @Service, @Repository, or @Controller annotations.
Defining beans in XML configuration files.
8.  What is default bean name for  @Component and  @Bean?
    For @Component (and related stereotypes like @Service, @Repository), the default bean name is the uncapitalized class name.
    For @Bean, the default bean name is the method name.
9.  What is the difference between  @component and  @service,@repository?
    @Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
    @Service annotates classes at the service layer.
    @Repository annotates classes at the persistence layer, which will act as a database repository.
10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?
    @Autowired (by type)
    @Resource (by name)
    @Inject (by type, similar to @Autowired but part of Java CDI).
11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans
    in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
    Constructor Injection
    Setter Injection
    Field Injection
Constructor Injection is often considered better due to its encouragement of immutability and the guarantee that required dependencies are not null.
12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let
    the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.
    Use @Primary to designate a bean as the primary candidate for autowiring when multiple beans match a given type.
    Use @Qualifier annotation to specify which bean to inject when there are multiple beans of the same type.
13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
    BeanFactory: The root interface for accessing the Spring container. It provides basic functionality for managing beans.
    ApplicationContext: Extends BeanFactory and adds more enterprise-specific functionality like easier integration with Spring's AOP features, message resources handling (for i18n), and event propagation.
14. What is the Scope of a Bean?  and list the examples for each scope.
    Defines the lifecycle and visibility of a bean within the application context.

Singleton (default): Only one instance of the bean is created for the Spring container.
Prototype: A new instance is created every time the bean is requested.
Request: A new instance is created for each HTTP request. (Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext)
Session: A new instance is created for each HTTP session. (Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring `
15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we
    configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml,
    and feel free to ask me any quesitons if you don't understand. it is a little bit old,
    I am not sure if I need to exaplain it in class)
    
    <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
    <constructor-arg ref="anotherBean"/>
    <property name="myProperty" value="someValue"/>
    </bean>
