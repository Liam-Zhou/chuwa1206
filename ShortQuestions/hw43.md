2. The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. Spring Boot Extension is Spring's convention-over-configuration solution intended to aid in creating production-grade Spring applications with minimal amounts of configuration.

3. Ioc: Inversion of control. Inversion of Control is a principle in software engineering which transfers the control of objects or portions of a program to a container or framework.

   Di: Dependency Injection. The third party like container or framework inject the dependency for us so we don't have to create them manually.

4. @ComponentScan indicates the package that we want spring to scan.

5. Xml: \<context:component-scan\>

   Annotation: @ComponentScan

6. @SpringbootApplication = @Configuration+@ComponentScan+@EnableAutoConfiguration

7. Xml: \<bean\>

   Annotations like @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller

   use @Bean in @Configuration class

8. @Component: class name with first letter in lower case

   @Bean: method name

9. They only differ semantically. @Service marks a class as a component, which is the same as @Component, and tells the programmer this class is in service layer.

10. - @Autowired
    - @Resource
    - @Inject

11. - Constructor injection
    - Setter injection
    - Field injection

    Constructor injection is better because it avoids circular denpendency and it has immutability.

12. @Primary. @Qualifier

13. - BeanFactory is the most basic version of IOC containers which should be preferred when memory consumption is critical whereas ApplicationContext extends BeanFactory, so you get all the benefits of BeanFactory plus some advanced features for enterprise applications .

    - BeanFactory instantiates beans on-demand i.e. when the method getBean(beanName) is called, it is also called Lazy initializer whereas ApplicationContext instantiates beans at the time of creating the container where bean scope is Singleton, so it is an Eager initializer.

    - BeanFactory only supports 2 bean scopes, singleton and prototype whereas ApplicationContext supports all bean scopes.

14. Spring framework supports 5 scopes, 

    singleton – only one bean instance per Spring IOC container 

    prototype – it produces a new instance each and every time a bean is requested 

    request – a single instance will be created and made available during complete life-cycle of an HTTP request 

    session – a single instance will be created and made available during complete life-cycle of an HTTP session 

    global session – a single instance will be created during the life-cycle of a ServletContext 

    @Scope annotation or scope attribute of bean tag can be used to define bean scopes in Spring.
