1. **What is Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)?** Aspect-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. It does so by adding additional behavior to existing code (an advice) without modifying the code itself, instead separately specifying which code is modified via a "pointcut" specification, such as "log all function calls when they are called".
2. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?**
   - Advantages:
     - **Modularity:** Helps in separating cross-cutting concerns (like logging, security) from the business logic.
     - **Reusability:** Allows for the reuse of aspects across multiple classes or methods.
     - **Improved Code Maintenance:** Changes to cross-cutting logic need to be made in one place rather than many.
     - **Decluttering:** Keeps business logic clean and focused by offloading aspects like logging and transactions.
   - Disadvantages:
     - **Performance Overhead:** Introducing AOP can add overhead to the application, although often negligible.
     - **Complexity:** Can make the flow of execution harder to follow, leading to maintenance challenges.
     - **Limited Support:** Spring AOP is proxy-based and supports method execution join points only, which may not cover all use cases like field access.
3. **What is an Aspect in Spring AOP?** In Spring AOP, an Aspect is a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes. It is a class that encapsulates behaviors affecting multiple classes into reusable modules. An aspect is defined with the `@Aspect` annotation.
4. **What is a Pointcut in Spring AOP?** A Pointcut is an expression that selects one or more join points. It is used to define at what join points an advice should be applied. For example, a pointcut could be defined to select all the methods of a certain name or all the methods that are annotated with a specific annotation.
5. **What is a Join Point in Spring AOP?** A Join Point is a point in the execution of the application where an aspect can be plugged in. In Spring AOP, a join point always represents a method execution.
6. **What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?** In Spring AOP, an Advice is an action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. Different types of advice include:
   - **Before:** Run before the method execution.
   - **After Returning:** Run after the method returns a result.
   - **After Throwing:** Run if the method throws an exception.
   - **After (finally):** Run after the method execution regardless of its outcome.
   - **Around:** Run before and after the advised method is invoked, offering the opportunity to control the method execution.
7. **When to use Spring Batch?** Spring Batch is used for processing large volumes of data, typically in batch jobs. It's ideal for scenarios where data needs to be processed in high volumes and in a scheduled, automated, and repeatable manner.
8. **How Spring Batch works?** Spring Batch works by dividing the batch processing into three major components: Reader, Processor, and Writer. The Reader reads data from a resource, the Processor processes the data (optional), and the Writer writes the processed data to a target resource. These components are orchestrated by a Job, which is configured using Step(s) that chain these components together.
9. **How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?** A Spring Batch Job can be scheduled using Spring's task scheduling capabilities, such as the `@Scheduled` annotation, or by integrating with a more robust scheduling framework like Quartz.
10. **What is a cron expression?** A cron expression is a string representing a schedule in a cron format. It consists of six or seven fields separated by white space that represent a set of times, normally as a schedule to execute some routine.
11. **What is the Spring task?** Spring Task is an abstraction around task execution and scheduling. It provides annotations and configuration to schedule tasks and run them asynchronously, abstracting away the underlying scheduling mechanism.
12. **When to use Spring Task?** Spring Task is used when simple asynchronous behavior is needed in an application, or for scheduling tasks to run at specific intervals without needing the full capabilities of a dedicated scheduling framework like Quartz.
13. **What is a Filter, and can you provide a filter example?** In Java, a Filter is an object that performs filtering tasks on either the request to a resource (a servlet or static content), or on the response from a resource, or both. For example, an `AuthenticationFilter` might check to see if the user is authenticated before allowing access to certain resources.
14. **What is an Interceptor? What can we do with an interceptor?** An Interceptor in Spring is used to intercept and process web requests before they reach the controller. Interceptors can perform operations before and after the execution of request handler methods. Common uses include logging, auditing, security checks, and transaction management.
15. **In an Interceptor, what is preHandle? What is postHandle?**
    - **preHandle:** Method in an interceptor that is called before the actual handler is executed. It can be used to perform operations before sending the request to the controller.
    - **postHandle:** Method in an interceptor that is called after the handler method has been executed but before the view is rendered. It can be used to perform operations before sending the response to the client.
16. **What is Swagger?** Swagger is an open-source software framework backed by a large ecosystem of tools that helps developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services. It provides a UI to document API endpoints and their related operations, making it easier for developers to understand and test APIs.
