 * What is the authentication?
- In authentication process, the identity of users are checked for providing the
  access to the system

* What is the authorization?
 -  While in authorization process, person’s or user’s authorities are checked for
    accessing the resources.

* What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
- authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to. 

* What is HTTP Session?
- A session is a server-side storage mechanism used to maintain state
  across multiple requests from the same user. When a user logs into a
  web application or performs an action that requires state management,
  a session is created on the server. A unique session ID is generated
  and sent to the client as a cookie or sometimes as a part of the
  URL.

* What is Cookie? 
- Cookies are produced by the web server and sent to the client
  through HTTP headers. When a browser receives a cookie, it stores it
  locally and includes it in future requests to the same server using the
  "Cookie" header.

* What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
- sessions are saved on the server side while cookies are saved on the client side.

* How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the
    application?
-  an API that retrieves a user's profile data while using
   cookies as part of its business logic. The user ID and preference cookies will be set during
   the login process, and then used by the profile API to tailor the response

* What is JWT?
- `jwt` is the most common scenario. Once the user is logged in, each
  subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access resources that are
  permitted with that token.

* What is the spring security filter
- Spring Security maintains a filter chain internally where each of the filters has a particular responsibility and filters are added or removed from the configuration depending on which services are required.

The primary filters used by Spring Security are part of the filter chain, which is configured to process requests in a specific order. Each filter in the chain performs a specific security-related task.

* Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
 - `BCryptPasswordEncoder`, `StandardPasswordEncoder`,`NoOpPasswordEncoder`

* What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
 - Disadvantage: Sessions often rely on cookies or URL rewriting to maintain session identifiers, leading to additional network overhead as the session ID needs to be transmitted with each request.
 - Solution: Minimize the size of session data and use techniques like cookie-less sessions or token-based approaches to reduce the amount of data transmitted over the network. Additionally, consider using secure and compact session storage mechanisms.

* how to get value from application.properties?
-   ```
    @Value("${property.key}")
    ```

* What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)
-`configure(HttpSecurity http)`:The configure(HttpSecurity http) method is responsible for configuring the security settings related to HTTP requests and defining access rules. It allows you to specify which paths are secured, who can access them, and how they are protected. Common configurations include:

- `authorizeRequests()`:Define access control rules based on URL patterns. Specify which roles or authorities are required to access certain URLs

* What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter
- The UserDetailsService interface is used to retrieve user details (including credentials and authorities) from a source (e.g., database, LDAP, in-memory) based on a username.
- The AuthenticationProvider interface is responsible for authenticating a user based on the provided Authentication object.
- The AuthenticationManager interface is a manager of AuthenticationProvider instances. It orchestrates the authentication process by delegating to one or more authentication providers.
- The UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter is a built-in filter provided by Spring Security for handling form-based authentication.
