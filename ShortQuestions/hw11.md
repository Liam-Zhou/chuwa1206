### 2. Authentication
Check the users' identities for providing the access to the system. In authentication process, users are verified. The process is done before the authorization process.
It needs users' login details and determines whether the person is user or not. It generally transmits information through an ID token.
### 3. Authorization
users' authorities are checked for accessing the resources. It is done after authentication part and persons are validated in this process.
It generally transmits information through an Access Token.
### 4. Authentication vs Authorization
- Authentication is done before Authorization
- Authentication needs users' login details, Authorization needs users' privilege or security levels
- Authentication determines whether the person is user or not. Authorization determines what permission do user have.
- Authentication transmits information through an ID token, Authorization transmits through an Access Token.
### 5. HTTP Session
HTTP sessions is an industry standard feature that allows Web servers to maintain user identity and to store user-specific data during multiple request/response interactions between a client application and a Web application.
### 6. Cookie
Cookie is a small piece of data sent from a web server to a user's browser. The browser stores the cookie and sends it back with each subsequent request to the same server.
### 7. Session vs Cookie
- Cookie is stored by browser and Session is stored by server.
- A unique Id of session is generated and sent to the client as a cookie.
- Clients can find cookies in the browser's storage but cannot directly access session data from the browser. You can only find the session ID in the browser.
### 8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application
- Server opens a session
- Server sets a session variable
- Client changes page
- Client sends all cookies along with the session ID
- Server reads session ID from cookies
- Server matches session ID from a list in a database(or memory)
- Server finds a match, reads variables.
### 9. jwt
JSON Web Token is a commonly used user authentication and authorization standard, used to exchange data in a secure manner.
Made up of three components, a header, a payload, and a signature, it's becoming more and more commonly used.
### 10. spring security filter
Spring Security maintains a filter chain internally where each of the filters has a particular responsibility and filters are added or removed from the configuration depending on which services are required.
### 11. how does JWT work
- post with username and password
- validate the username and password, generate the JWT using secret key
- return the generated JWT
- get with jwt in the Header
- validate jwt using secret key
- return the response
### 12. Encoder
PasswordEncoder is defined in the Spring Security configuration to encode the password.
### 13. UserDetailService, AuthenticationProvider, AuthenticationManager, AuthenticationFilter
UserDetailService is used by DaoAuthenticationProvider for retrieving a username, a password, and other attributes for authenticating.
AuthenticationProvider refers to an entity that provides authentication services.
AuthenticationManager manages the authentication modules that an application uses
AuthenticationFilter a component that authenticates an HTTP request.
### 14. disadvantage of session
- performance overhead in case of large number of user because of session data stored in server memory.
- optimize session management by using efficient storage mechanisms and regularly clean up expired sessions to free up resources.
### 15. get value from application.properties
@Value
### 16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)
configure(HttpSecurity http) is responsible for configuring security at the HTTP level, including authorization and other security-related settings.
configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) is responsible for configuring the authentication manager, which is used to authenticate users
### 17. What is Spring security authentication and authorization
- Authentication is done before Authorization
- Authentication needs users' login details, Authorization needs users' privilege or security levels
- Authentication determines whether the person is user or not. Authorization determines what permission do user have.
- Authentication transmits information through an ID token, Authorization transmits through an Access Token.
