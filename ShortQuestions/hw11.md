### 2. What is the authentication?
Authentication is verifying the identity of a user or entity in a system, ensuring they are who they claim to be.

### 3. What is the authorization?
Authorization is determining if a user or entity has permission to access or perform operations in a system, usually after authentication.

### 4. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
- Authentication verifies user identity.
- Authorization determines access rights and permissions after authentication.

### 5. What is HTTP Session?
An HTTP session is a server-side storage feature that retains user data across multiple requests during a visit to a website or application.

### 6. What is Cookie?
A cookie is a small piece of data stored on the user's device by the browser to remember information about the user, such as preferences or login status.

### 7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
- Sessions store data on the server, keeping user data secure.
- Cookies store data on the client, often containing identifiers to track user sessions.

### 8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the application?
- Sessions are used to store user data on the server, providing a reference ID for the data stored.
- Cookies store these session IDs on the client, which are sent back to the server to retrieve session data.

### 9. What is JWT?
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe format for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, commonly used for authentication and information exchange.

### 10. What is the spring security filter?
Spring Security Filter is a series of filters providing security features for HTTP requests in Spring applications, such as authentication and authorization.

### 11. Describe how do JWT work (slides have diagrams, page 26)
JWT consists of three parts:
- Header: Specifies the token type and the algorithm used for signing.
- Payload: Contains the claims, providing information about the user and additional data.
- Signature: Ensures the token hasn't been altered and verifies the sender's identity.

### 12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
Yes, using a password encoder like `BCryptPasswordEncoder` or `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder` provided by Spring Security ensures passwords are securely stored.

### 13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider? AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?
- `UserDetailsService`: Retrieves user-related data, particularly used for authentication.
- `AuthenticationProvider`: Offers the mechanism for authentication, defining the contract for authentication implementations.
- `AuthenticationManager`: Interface providing the API for processing an authentication request.
- `AuthenticationFilter`: Processes authentication requests, filtering incoming requests based on authentication needs.

### 14. What is the disadvantage of Session? How to overcome the disadvantage?
- Disadvantage: Sessions can lead to scalability issues as they consume server memory.
- Overcoming: Use session clustering, session persistence, or stateless authentication methods like JWT to alleviate memory burden.

### 15. How to get value from application.properties?
Values can be fetched from `application.properties` using:
- `@Value` annotation to inject property values into components.
- `Environment` object to programmatically retrieve properties.

### 16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
- `configure(HttpSecurity http)`: Configures web security at the resource level, setting URL-based security, form login configurations, and logout handling.
- `configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)`: Configures user-detail services for authentication, setting up in-memory, JDBC, or LDAP authentication, among other authentication providers.

### 17. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
- Authentication in Spring Security ensures and confirms a user's identity.
- Authorization determines if the authenticated user has proper permissions for accessing certain resources or operations.
Spring Security offers a comprehensive set of functionalities for securing Java applications, particularly focused on Spring-based apps.
