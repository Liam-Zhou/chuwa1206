1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotations.md
2. What is the authentication?

   Authentication determines whether a user can login to the application

3. What is the authorization?

   Authorization determines whether a user can have the power to do certain tasks

4. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

   | Authentication                                                                           | Authorization                                                                    |
   | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | In authentication process, an identity is checked for providing the access to the system | In an authorization process, an authority is checked for accessing the resources |
   | a user is verified in authentication process                                             | a user is validated in authorization process                                     |
   | Authentication is done before the authorization process                                  | Authorization is done after the authentication process                           |
   | Authentication needs user login info                                                     | Authorization needs to know a user's privilege or security levels                |
   | Authentication determines whether a person is a user                                     | Authorization determines what permissions a user has                             |
   | Authentication generally transmits information through an ID token                       | Authorization generally transmits information through an access token            |

5. What is HTTP Session?

   A session is stored on server to maintain state across multiple requests from a user.

6. What is Cookie?

   A cookie is produced by server and sent to the client to track user and remember the user's preferences

7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?

   | Session                                                                                                             | Cookie                                    |
   | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
   | stores on server                                                                                                    | stores on client                          |
   | user cannot see is directly, but they can see the session id, which is used by the server to associate with session | can directly see cookies from the browser |

8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application?

   Server uses session id stored in cookie to retrieve a user's session on a central storage (maybe a redis) to be used by the current server.

9. What is JWT?

   JWT stands for JSON Web token. It is the encrypted user information that is usually stored in user cookies or local storages. The server can decrypt JWT to get user information.

10. What is the spring security filter?

    Spring security filter basically filters requests and executes corresponding code.

11. describe how do JWT work(slides ⾥有图， 26 页)

    - client posts username and password to /authenticate endpoint
    - Server verifies the credential and generates the JWT using a secret key.
    - Server returns the generated JWT
    - Client sends requests with JWT in the header
    - Server validates JWT and responses to client

12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?

    Bcrypt is one of the password encoders

13. What is UserDetailsService? AuthenticationProvider? AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter? (把这⼏个名字看熟悉也⾏)

    - UserDetailsService is used by DaoAuthenticationProvider for retrieving a username, a password, and other attributes for authenticating with a username and password
    - AuthenticationProvider is used to handle authentication requests and returns a fully authenticated object with full credentials
    - AuthenticationManager attempts to authenticate the passed authentication object, returning a fully populated authentication object if successful
    - AuthenticationFilter is a filter that performs authentication of a particular object

14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?

    When we have multiple servers, the session has to be stored in a central storage such as redis, which is a burden to the storage.

    We can instead use JWT so that each node can decode information itself instead of retrieving information from central storage

15. how to get value from application.properties?

    For example, we have

    ```
    app.jwt-secret = JWTSecreteKey
    ```

    in application.properties, we can use

    ```
    @Value(${app.jwt-secret})
    private String jwtSecrete
    ```

    to store value from application.properties in jwtSecrete variable

16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?

    - configure(HttpSecurity http) is used to configure security at HTTP level (for security)
    - configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) is used to define how user authentication should be performed (for authentication)

17. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?

    Authentication is to determine whether a person is a user to the system. Authorization is to determine whether a user has permission to access certain part of the system.
