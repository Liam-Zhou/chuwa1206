    - `test` - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
    - `package` - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
    - `verify` - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
    - `install` - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
    - `deploy` - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
