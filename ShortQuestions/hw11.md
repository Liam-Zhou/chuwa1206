## What is the authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of an entity, such as a user, system, or device, to ensure that it is who or what it claims to be.

## What is the authorization?

Authorization is the process of determining the permissions or privileges granted to an authenticated entity (such as a user, system, or application) to access specific resources or perform certain actions within a system or application. 

## What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

Authentication deals with verifying the identity of an entity, while authorization deals with determining what that authenticated entity is allowed to do or access. Both are crucial components of a comprehensive security strategy, working together to control access and protect resources within a system or application.

## What is HTTP Session?

An HTTP Session is a mechanism that allows web applications to maintain stateful information across multiple requests and responses between a client (typically a web browser) and a web server. It will store the session Id to represents some sensetive information and send back to the browser.

## What is Cookie?

A cookie is a small piece of data stored by a web browser on a user's device, which is sent between the browser and the server in HTTP requests and responses. Cookies are commonly used to track and maintain information about a user's interactions with a website or web application. They provide a way for websites to store data on a user's device and retrieve it later.

## What is the difference between Session and Cookie?

Sessions often involve the use of cookies to store session identifiers on the client side. The session identifier helps the server associate subsequent requests with the correct session data.

## How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application?

First first time, we send an API to server including the user information. In the server, it will store the information to session and have a mapping with an sessionId, the server set a cookies and store the sessionId, then send the cookies back to the client, the cookies will be stored in the browser.

Then, if we send other APIs in the same browser, the server will check the cookies' to find the sessionID, then find the user information by the sessionID.

## What is JWT?

JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. JWTs are often used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications and APIs. 

Advantages of JWT:

1. Compact and URL-safe: JWTs are designed to be easily transmitted over the network, even in URL query parameters.

2. Stateless: Since JWTs contain all the necessary information, servers can validate and process them without needing to store session data.

## What is the spring security filter?

The security filter chain is a series of filters that are responsible for handling various aspects of security in a web application. Each filter in the chain is designed to perform a specific security-related task, such as authentication, authorization, and protection against common security threats. The filters are organized in a chain, and each filter can modify the request, response, or both as they pass through the chain.

The Spring Security filter chain is configured in the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class, which allows developers to customize and extend the security configuration based on their application's requirements.

## Decribe how do JWT work.

Token Creation (Server Side):
When a user logs in or authenticates, the server generates a JWT, including relevant claims such as the user ID, roles, or other necessary information. The server signs the JWT using a secret key (for symmetric algorithms) or a private key (for asymmetric algorithms) to create the signature.

Token Transmission (Client Side): The server sends the JWT to the client, typically in the HTTP response header (e.g., Authorization header) or as part of the response body.

Token Storage (Client Side): The client stores the JWT, often in memory or in a secure storage mechanism, depending on the application's requirements.

Token Inclusion in Requests (Client Side): In subsequent requests to protected resources, the client includes the JWT, usually in the Authorization header using the "Bearer" authentication scheme.

Token Verification (Server Side): When the server receives a request with a JWT, it verifies the signature using the same secret or public key used for signing. This ensures the integrity and authenticity of the token. The server decodes the base64-encoded payload to retrieve the claims and processes them as needed.

Access Control (Server Side): The server uses the claims from the decoded JWT to make access control decisions. For example, it checks whether the user has the required roles or permissions to access a resource.

Token Expiration: JWTs can have an expiration time (specified in the exp claim), and the server may enforce token expiration to manage security risks. If a token has expired, the server may require the client to obtain a new one.

## Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?

PasswordEncoder interface is commonly used to handle password hashing. Spring Security provides several implementations of this interface, and one of the widely used ones is BCryptPasswordEncoder. It uses the bcrypt hashing algorithm, which is known for its strength against brute-force attacks and is considered a secure choice for password hashing.

## What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?

UserDetailService is an interface in Spring Security that is used to retrieve user-related data. It is responsible for loading user-specific data such as username, password, and authorities from a backend store during the authentication process.

AuthenticationProvider supports the authentication request represented by a specific Authentication class. It returns true if the provider can process the authentication request for the given Authentication class. This method is crucial when there are multiple authentication providers configured, and each provider is responsible for different types of authentication.

AuthenticationManager delegates the authentication request to each provider in the chain until one of them successfully authenticates the user or all providers fail.

AuthenticationFilter is a crucial component in Spring Security that handles the processing of authentication requests, especially in scenarios where users submit their credentials through a form.

## What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?

While sessions are a common and convenient mechanism for maintaining state in web applications, addressing their potential disadvantages involves optimizing storage, considering distributed solutions, and being mindful of security concerns.

We can use the cache or redis to store the session. Each server can access the redis and search session.

## how to get value from application.properties?

1. Using @Value Annotation: @Value("${property.key}")

2. Using Environment:
    private Environment environment;

    public String getPropertyValue() {
        return environment.getProperty("property.key");
    }

3. Using @ConfigurationProperties:

custom.propertyKey = customValue

@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "custom")

private String propertyKey

## What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?

The configure(HttpSecurity http) method is responsible for configuring security settings related to HTTP requests. It defines how requests should be handled in terms of authentication, authorization, and other security-related configurations. 

The configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) method is responsible for configuring how Spring Security authenticates users. It defines the mechanism used to verify user credentials and retrieve user details.

## What is Spring security authentication and authorization?

In Spring Security, authentication and authorization are fundamental concepts that ensure the security of a web application by controlling access to resources and verifying the identity of users.

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, typically by validating the provided credentials (such as username and password). Spring Security provides a flexible authentication framework that supports various authentication mechanisms. 

Authorization is the process of determining whether an authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access a particular resource or perform a specific action. Spring Security provides a flexible and declarative way to define access control rules.
