## HW11

####  What is the authentication?
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of the user
####  What is the authorization?
Authorization is the process of verifying if a user has the permission to access specific resources

####  What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
Authentication verifies user's identity while authorization determines user's permission and accessibility

####  What is HTTP Session?
An HTTP session is a way to store information about a user across multiple requests. It allows web applications to maintain stateful information about users and their interactions with the application.

####  What is Cookie? 
A cookie is a small piece of data transfering between servers and web browsers. It is stored on the client's computer by the web browser.

#### What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
Cookies are stored in web browser while sessions are stored on the server-side. Session is more secure thus being used for more sensitive data.

####  How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application? 
We store users' specific data in session and store a session ID in cookie so that we can retrieve it as the key. We also store users' preference in Cookie.

####  What is JWT?
JWT stands for JSON web token, it is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. JWTs are often used for authentication and information exchange in a secure manner. A JWT is a string consisting of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature.

####  What is the spring security filter?
Spring Security uses filters to implement security features. Filters are applied to HTTP requests and responses to perform tasks such as authentication, authorization, logging, and more.

####  decribe how do JWT work
JWT consists of three parts - header, payload and signiture. The server generates JWT, sends it the client. The client then add it in subsequent requests. The server verifies the JWT's signature and extracts information from the payload to authenticate and authorize the user.

####  Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
Yes of course. One commonly used password encoder in Spring Security is BCryptPasswordEncoder. It uses the BCrypt hashing algorithm.

####  What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?
`UserDetailService`: Retrieves user details.
`AuthenticationProvider`: Authenticates users based on provided credentials.
`AuthenticationManager`: Manages the authentication process.
`AuthenticationFilter`: Handles the actual authentication process.

#### What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
1. Session takes up resources(storage) of the server.
2. When the application scales up, and the application is served by multiple servers, sessions stored in one server are not neccessarily aware of by other servers, thus session sharing is required. However it makes the system complicated. 
To overcome it, we can consider using JWT.

#### How to get value from application.properties?
In a Spring application, you can use the `@Value` annotation or the Environment API to access values from application.properties or application.yml.

#### What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and  configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
`configure(HttpSecurity http)`: Configures security settings such as authorization rules, login/logout configurations, and more.
`configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)`: Configures how users are authenticated, including user details and password encoding.
