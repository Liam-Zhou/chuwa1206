1. list all of the new annotations you learned to your annotations.md
2. Document the microservice architecture and components/tools/dependencies

   - Spring Cloud
   - Gateway: Zuul API Gateway, Spring Cloud Gateway
   - Service Registry: Eureka, Consul
   - Load Balancer: Ribbon Load Balancer
   - Circuit Breaker: Hystrix Circuit Breaker
   - Config Center: Spring Cloud Config Center
   - Message Queue: Kafka
   - Docker

3. What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?

   Resilience pattern is a set of mechanism used in microservice architectures to empower applications to manage failure gracefully and ensure the stability of complex, distributed system.

   When a service request fails repeatedly, the circuit breaker will open and stop all calls to that service. When the service recovers, the circuit breaker closes the circuit and restores connection and service.

4. Read this article, then list the important questions, then write your answers

   a. https://www.interviewbit.com/microservices-interview-questions/#main-features-of-microservices

   - How independent microservices communicate with each other?
     - HTTP/REST with JSON for request-response.
     - Websocket for streaming
     - Message queue
   - What do you mean by end-to-end microservices testing
     - It is a technique to ensure that all components work together and all processes in the work flow works properly. It is usually done through user interface, mimicking how it appears to the user.

5. how to do load balance in microservice? Write a long Summary by yourself.

   a. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/load-balancer-system-design-interview-question/

   b. https://www.fullstack.cafe/blog/load-balancing-interview-questions

   There are multiple places where we can do load balancing. We can do it between users and application, between application and services, and between services and databases.

   Load balancing is a way to keep fair loading between servers by sending traffic to appropriate node.

   There are also different methods to implement load balancing: round robin, weighted round robin, least connection method, least response time method, source IP hash, and power of two random choices.

   Load balancing is important to applications with heavy workload and in need to spread traffic evenly among the nodes.

6. How to do service discovery?

   When a service is up, it registers itself to the service registry such as Eureka to let other service calls the service. When a service leaves the system, it moves itself from the registry.

7. What are the major components of Kafka?

   Major components of Kafka includes Topics, Zookeeper, Brokers, Producers, and Consumers.

8. What do you mean by a Partition in Kafka?

   A broker stores messages in different topics and sends them. When one machine is not enough to store all the messages, we can have multiple partitions on different machines to store more data.

9. What do you mean by zookeeper in Kafka and what are its uses?

   Since Kafka is a distributes system, it uses Zookeeper to track status of Kafka nodes for coordination. It also keeps track of Kafka topics, partitions, and offsets.

10. Can we use Kafka without Zookeeper?

    If we use Kafka Raft Metadata mode, we can use Kafka without Zookeeper.

11. Explain the concept of Leader and Follower in Kafka.

    Each partition has one leader and zero or more followers. The leader will handle the read/write requests of that partition while the followers only stores replication of data from the leader. Once a leader shuts down for some reason, one of its in-sync followers becomes the new leader.

12. Why is Topic Replication important in Kafka? What do you mean by ISR in Kafka?

    We use replication to ensure the durability and availability of Kafka service even when some servers are down.

    ISR stands for in-sync replica. It refers the replica that reads from the leader without lagging behind and losing connection.

13. What do you understand about a consumer group in Kafka?

    A consumer reads messages from Kafka broker. A consumer group is a group of consumers that may subscribe different or same topics. If they subscribe the same topic, they will still receive different messages.

14. How do you start a Kafka server?

    Get Kafka, start Kafka environment

15. Tell me about some of the real-world usages of Apache Kafka.

    Feed logs into centralized log system, track user activity data across devices and channels.

16. Describe partitioning key in Kafka.

    kafka producers relies on key of record to decide which partition to write records. Two records with the same key will usually be sent to the same partition.

17. What is the purpose of partitions in Kafka?

    To store more data on the system. It also enables parallel processing of records across multiple brokers.

18. Differentiate between RabbitMq and Kafka.

    Kafka emphasizes on large throughput of data while RabbitMq emphasizes on reliability.

19. What are the guarantees that Kafka provides?

    - At most once delivery
    - At least once delivery
    - Exactly once delivery

20. What do you mean by an unbalanced cluster in Kafka? How can you balance it?

    The cluster is in a leader skewed state when a node is a leader for more partitions than the number of partitions/number of brokers. In order to solve this, Kafka has the facility of reassigning leaders to the preferred replicas.

21. In your recent project, are you a producer or consumer or both?
22. In your recent project, Could you tell me your topic name?
23. In your recent project, How many brokers do you have? How many partitions for each topic? How many data for each topic.
24. In your recent project, which team produce what kind of event to you and you producer what kind of events?
25. What is offset?

    An offset is a sequence number assigned to each message to each partition of a Kafka topic.
