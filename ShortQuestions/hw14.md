### 2. microservice architecture and components/tools/dependencies
Microservices architecture is an approach to developing software applications as a collection of small, 
independent services that can be deployed, scaled, and maintained separately.

components: Spring cloud, Spring Cloud gateway, consul, Ribbon, Resilience4j, Spring cloud config, kafka, docker
### 3. Resilience pattern, circuit breaker
Resiliency patterns in microservices are a set of established mechanisms that empower applications to 
manage failures gracefully, ensuring stability in the face of complex, distributed systems.

A circuit breaker is an electrical switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by overcurrent/overload or short circuit
### 4. microservice interview questions and answers
- Explain the working of Microservice Architecture
  - Clients: Different users send requests from various devices. 
  - Identity Provider: Validate a user's or client's identity and issue security tokens. 
  - API Gateway: Handles the requests from clients. 
  - Static Content: Contains all of the system's content. 
  - Management: Services are balanced on nodes and failures are identified. 
  - Service Discovery: A guide to discovering the routes of communication between microservices. 
  - Content Delivery Network: Includes distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. 
  - Remote Service: Provides remote access to data or information that resides on networked computers and devices.
- What are the benefits of Microservices
  - Self-contained, and independent deployment module. 
  - Independently managed services.
  - In order to improve performance, the demand service can be deployed on multiple servers.
  - It is easier to test and has fewer dependencies.
  - A greater degree of scalability and agility.
  - Simplicity in debugging & maintenance.
  - Better communication between developers and business users.
  - Development teams of a smaller size.
- What are the drawbacks of Microservices
  - Due to the complexity of the architecture, testing and monitoring are more difficult.
  - Lacks the proper corporate culture for it to work.
  - Pre-planning is essential.
  - Complex development.
  - Requires a cultural shift.
  - Expensive compared to monoliths.
  - Security implications. 
  - Maintaining the network is more difficult.
- Write main features of Microservices
  - Decoupling: Within a system, services are largely decoupled. The application as a whole can therefore be easily constructed, altered, and scalable 
  - Componentization: Microservices are viewed as independent components that can easily be exchanged or upgraded 
  - Business Capabilities: Microservices are relatively simple and only focus on one service 
  - Team autonomy: Each developer works independently of each other, allowing for a faster project timeline 
  - Continuous Delivery: Enables frequent software releases through systematic automation of software development, testing, and approval 
  - Responsibility: Microservices are not focused on applications as projects. Rather, they see applications as products they are responsible for 
  - Decentralized Governance: Choosing the right tool according to the job is the goal. Developers can choose the best tools to solve their problems 
  - Agility: Microservices facilitate agile development. It is possible to create new features quickly and discard them again at any time.
### 5. how to do load balance in microservice
Load balancers distribute heavy traffic load across the servers running in the cluster based on several different algorithms
- client side load balancer
- server side load balancer
### 6. service discovery
Service discovery is the process of automatically detecting devices and services on a network. Service discovery protocol (SDP) is a networking 
standard that accomplishes detection of networks by identifying resources.
### 7. major components of Kafka
producer, consumer, broker, topic, partition, offset, zookeeper, consumer groups, replication, Kafka connect, Kafka streams
### 8. Partition in Kafka
Partitioning takes the single topic log and breaks it into multiple logs, each of which can live on a separate node in the Kafka cluster. 
This way, the work of storing messages, writing new messages, and processing existing messages can be split among many nodes in the cluster.
### 9. zookeeper in Kafka
Zookeeper is used for metadata management in the Kafka world. For example: Zookeeper keeps track of which brokers are part of the Kafka cluster. 
Zookeeper is used by Kafka brokers to determine which broker is the leader of a given partition and topic and perform leader elections.
### 10. Can we use Kafka without Zookeeper
In Kafka Raft Metadata mode, the brokers coordinate with each other using a consensus protocol called Raft, which enables them to 
elect a leader and replicate metadata across the cluster without relying on an external system like ZooKeeper
### 11. Leader and Follower in Kafka
This means that the leader node is responsible for the first instance of each partition, and the follower node ensures that it is replicated on each server.
### 12. why is Topic Replication important, ISR in Kafka
Kafka topic replication is a technique which helps kafka to ensure high availability of a topic ie; even if the node having a topic goes down, 
replication ensures that any other node in the cluster would still be able to serve the requests for that topic.

ISR refers to the replicas of a partition that are “in sync” with the leader. The leader is the replica to which all client and broker requests are directed. 
The replicas that are not the leader are referred to as followers.
### 13. consumer group in Kafka
A consumer group is a set of consumers which cooperate to consume data from some topics. The partitions of all the topics are divided among the consumers in the group. 
As new group members arrive and old members leave, the partitions are re-assigned so that each member receives a proportional share of the partitions.
### 14. how to start a Kafka server
- get Kafka
- start the Kafka environment
- create a topic to store the events
- write some events into the topic - producer
- read the events - consumer
- import/export the data as streams of events with Kafka connect
- process the events with Kafka streams
- terminate the Kafka environment
### 15. real-world usage of Apache Kafka
log aggregation, event sourcing, message system, stream processing, real-time analytics, metrics and monitoring
### 16. partitioning key in Kafka
By default, Kafka producer relies on the key of the record to decide to which partition to write the record. For two records with the same key, 
the producer will always choose the same partition.
### 17. purpose of partitions in Kafka
These partitions allow users to parallelize topics, meaning data for any topic can be divided over multiple brokers. 
Since a topic can be split into partitions over multiple machines, multiple consumers can read a topic in parallel. 
This organization sets Kafka up for high message throughput.
### 18. Rabbitmq and Kafka
RabbitMQ brokers can be distributed and configured to be reliable in case of network or server failure. Apache Kafka, on the other hand, 
is described as a distributed event streaming platform. Rather than focusing on flexible routing, it instead facilitates raw throughput
### 19. what are the guarantees that Kafka provides
Fault tolerance, durability, scalability, ordering guarantees, retention policies, schema evolution
### 20. unbalanced cluster in Kafka, how to balance it
An unbalanced cluster can generate unnecessary disk, CPU problems or even the need to add another broker to handle unexpected traffic.

- create the original files
- gather data for rebalance calculation
- run over the topics and partitions and create migration files
- run tests
### 25. offset
The offset is a unique ID assigned to the partitions, which contains messages. The most important use is that it identifies the messages through ID, 
which are available in the partitions. In other words, it is a position within a partition for the next message to be sent to a consumer.
