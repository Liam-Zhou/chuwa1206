## What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?

- Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that allows developers to modularize cross-cutting concerns in software applications. 

- A cross-cutting concern is a feature or requirement that affects multiple parts of an application and cannot be cleanly encapsulated within a single module or class. Examples of cross-cutting concerns include logging, security, transaction management, and error handling.

## What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?

- Pros: modularization of cross-cutting concerns, improved maintainability, losse coupling, declarative configuration, integration with Spring

- Cons: limited pointcut expressiveness, proxy-based approach, performance overhead, limited support for compile-time weaving

## What is Aspect in Spring AOP?

- An aspect is a modular unit of cross-cutting functionality that encapsulates a concern, such as logging or security.

- Aspects define reusable code that can be applied to multiple parts of the application without modifying the core business logic.

- Aspects typically consist of advice and pointcuts.

## What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?

- A pointcut is a set of join points, which are specific points in the execution flow of the application, where advice can be applied.

- Pointcuts define the criteria for selecting join points based on method signatures, class names, annotations, or other attributes.

- Pointcuts determine when and where advice should be applied.

## What is the Join Point in Spring AOP?

- A join point is a specific point in the execution flow of the application where advice can be applied.
- Examples of join points include method invocations, method executions, field accesses, and object instantiations.

## What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?

- Advice is the actual implementation of cross-cutting functionality that is applied at specific points in the execution of the application.
- Types of advice include "before" advice (executed before a join point), "after" advice (executed after a join point), "around" advice (wraps a join point), and "after-throwing" advice (executed after an exception is thrown).
- Advice is typically written as methods in aspect classes.

## When to use Spring Batch?

- data processing and transformation

- batch jobs and scheduled tasks

- large-scale data import and export

- parallel and scalable processing

- error handling and retry mechanisms

## How does Spring Batch work?

- Spring Batch works by defining jobs composed of one or more steps, each with an ItemReader, ItemProcessor, and ItemWriter. It provides infrastructure components such as the JobRepository and JobLauncher to manage job execution and state. Spring Batch facilitates the efficient processing of large volumes of data by providing reusable components, error-handling mechanisms, and transaction management capabilities.

## How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?

- Use the `@Scheduled` annotation to schedule method invocations at fixed intervals or cron expressions. Inside the scheduled method, use a `JobLauncher` to launch and execute the Spring Batch Job.

- OR use xml configurations `<task:scheduled ref="batchJobScheduler" method="runBatchJob" cron="0 0 0 * * ?"/>`

## What is the cron expression?

- A cron expression is a string representation of a schedule or time pattern used to define when a task or job should be executed. It consists of five or six fields separated by whitespace, representing different aspects of the schedule: seconds, minutes, hours, day of month, month, and optionally, day of week. Each field can contain one or more values or special characters to define the schedule.

- basic format `second minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`

## What is the Spring task?

- In Spring Framework, the term "Spring Task" typically refers to the task scheduling capabilities provided by the Spring Framework's Task Execution and Scheduling support. Spring provides convenient abstractions and APIs for scheduling tasks, executing asynchronous methods, and managing thread pools.

## When to use the Spring task?

- Asynchronous Processing

- Scheduled Tasks

- Concurrency Management

- Batch Processing

- Background Jobs and Maintenance Tasks

## What is a Filter? Any filter example?

- In the context of web applications, a filter is a component that intercepts HTTP requests and responses before they reach the servlet or after they have been processed by the servlet.

```java
@WebFilter("/*")
public class LoggingFilter implements Filter {

    @Override
    public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {
        // Initialization logic, called when the filter is initialized
    }

    @Override
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, ServletException {
        // Pre-processing logic before the request reaches the servlet
        System.out.println("LoggingFilter: Request received for " + ((HttpServletRequest) request).getRequestURI());

        // Pass the request and response to the next filter in the chain
        chain.doFilter(request, response);

        // Post-processing logic after the response has been processed by the servlet
        System.out.println("LoggingFilter: Response sent for " + ((HttpServletRequest) request).getRequestURI());
    }

    @Override
    public void destroy() {
        // Cleanup logic, called when the filter is being destroyed
    }
}

```

## What is the Interceptor? What we can do with the interceptor?

- In the context of web applications, an interceptor (also known as an interceptor pattern) is a design pattern that allows you to intercept and modify the behavior of method invocations, typically used in frameworks like Spring MVC, Jakarta EE, and Hibernate. 

- Interceptors provide a way to add cross-cutting concerns or perform additional processing before or after method execution without modifying the target object's code directly.

## In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?

- In Spring MVC interceptors, `preHandle`, `postHandle`, and `afterCompletion` are methods that are invoked at different stages of request processing, allowing you to intercept and customize the behavior of controller methods before and after their execution. These methods are part of the `HandlerInterceptor` interface, which defines the contract for interceptors in Spring MVC.

## What is Swagger?

- Swagger is an open-source framework that allows developers to design, document, and consume RESTful web services easily. It provides a set of tools and specifications for defining and describing REST APIs in a machine-readable format, enabling automated generation of interactive API documentation, client SDKs, and server stubs.
