3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?

    - AOP is a programming technique that supports the separation of cross-cutting concerns in order to increase modularity.
      It defines functionality that is required in multiple places across an application in one place. You can add new functionality before or after a method is executed like transaction management, logging or security which cut across multiple types and objects

4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?

    - Advantages: Modularity, Code Reusability, Maintainability, Loose Coupling, Integration with Spring IoC, Multiple Advice Types.
    - Disadvantages: 
       1. Debugging the AOP framework-based application code is a little challenge.
      2. Aspects cannot be advised by other aspects.
      3. Runtime Overhead: The dynamic nature of runtime weaving in Spring AOP can introduce some runtime overhead.
      4. Limited Pointcut Expressiveness: While Spring AOP provides a range of pointcut expressions, its expressiveness is not as extensive as tools like AspectJ.
      5. Limited Support for Static Cross-Cutting: Spring AOP primarily focuses on runtime weaving, and its support for static cross-cutting concerns during compile-time is limited compared to full AspectJ.
      

5. What is Aspect in Spring AOP?

    - In Spring AOP, the @Aspect annotation is used to define a Java class as an aspect.

6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?

    - In Spring AOP, the @Pointcut annotation is used to define a named pointcut.

7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?

    - A join point is a specific point in the execution of a program where an aspect's advice can be applied.

8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?

    - Advice refers to the actual code that is executed when a particular join point is reached during the program's execution.
    - There are several types of advice in Spring AOP, each corresponding to a specific point in the execution of a program.

10. When to use Spring Batch?

   - It is particularly useful in scenarios where large volumes of data need to be processed efficiently in a batch mode.
      1. Large-Scale Data Processing
     2. Data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Operations
     3. Scheduled Batch Jobs:
     4. Data Cleansing and Validation

11. How Spring Batch works?
    - Spring Batch works by providing a set of abstractions and components that facilitate the development and execution of batch processing jobs
      1. Job Specification: At the core of Spring Batch is the concept of a "job." A job is a collection of steps, where each step represents a unit of work to be executed. A job is defined using a combination of XML configuration, Java configuration, or both.
      2. Step Configuration: Each job consists of one or more steps. A step typically comprises three main components: 
         1. ItemReader: Reads data from a source, such as a file, database, or other data source.
         2. ItemProcessor: Processes the read data, performs business logic, and transforms the data if necessary.
         3. ItemWriter: Writes the processed data to a destination, such as a database, file, or other data store.

12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?

   - One common approach is to use the @Scheduled annotation along with Spring's TaskScheduler or CronTrigger for more advanced scheduling scenarios. 


13. What is the cron expression?

    - A cron expression is a string representing a schedule based on the cron syntax. It is used for defining the schedule of recurring tasks in various systems.

14. What is the spring task?
    
    - "Spring Task" refers to a lightweight scheduling tool provided by the Spring framework. This tool allows developers to easily set up and execute scheduled tasks within a Spring application without the need for additional third-party dependencies.

15. When to use Spring task?

    1. Periodic Jobs
    2. Automated Maintenance
    3. Background Jobs
    4. Scheduled Alerts
    5. Cron Jobs
    6. Recurring Tasks
    7. Automatic Order Cancellation for Unpaid Orders
    8. Scheduled Data Crawling
    9. Scheduled Information Push
    10. Scheduled Article Publication
    11. Scheduled Report Generation

16. What is Filter and any filter example?

    - In Java web development, a filter is a component that performs filtering tasks on the request to a resource, the response from a resource, or both. Filters are used to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests and responses. Filters are configured in the deployment descriptor (web.xml) and can perform tasks such as logging, authentication, data transformation, or modification of request and response objects.

17. What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?

    - interceptor is a component that allows you to intercept and process HTTP requests and responses. Interceptors operate on the level of Spring's MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework and can be used to perform tasks such as pre-processing requests, post-processing responses, or modifying the model before it reaches the view.

18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?

    - In Spring MVC interceptors, the preHandle and postHandle methods are part of the HandlerInterceptor interface. These methods allow you to intercept and handle requests at different stages of the request-handling process.
    - preHandle:  is called before the actual handler method (controller method) is invoked to process the request.
    - postHandle: is called after the controller method has been invoked but before the view is rendered.

19. What is Swagger?

    - Swagger is an open-source framework/a set of tools that simplifies the process of designing, documenting, and understanding and using RESTful APIs.
