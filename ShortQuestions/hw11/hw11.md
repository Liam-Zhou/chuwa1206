What is the authentication? Authentication is the process of verifying who someone is. It involves checking a user's identity, usually through a username and password, to ensure they are who they claim to be.

# 3

What is the authorization? Authorization is the process of giving someone permission to do or have something. In computer systems, after a user is authenticated, they are granted access to different resources based on their permissions.

# 4

What is the difference between authentication and authorization? The main difference is that authentication verifies who the user is, while authorization determines what resources a user can access. Authentication is about identities, and authorization is about permissions.

# 5

What is HTTP Session? An HTTP Session is a way to store information about a user across multiple web page requests. It's used to remember user data as they navigate a website, ensuring a consistent and personalized experience.

# 6

What is Cookie? A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by their web browser. Cookies are used to remember information about the user, such as login details or website preferences.

# 7

What is the difference between Session and Cookie? The main difference is where they store data. Sessions store data on the server side, while cookies store data on the client's browser. Sessions are considered more secure, as the data is not exposed to the user's browser.

# 8

How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the application? Sessions and cookies are used together to maintain user information. A session ID is stored in a cookie on the user's browser. This ID is sent to the server with each request, allowing the server to retrieve the user's session information.

# 9

What is JWT? JWT, or JSON Web Token, is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It's often used for authentication and information exchange, encoding user details in a secure manner.

# 10

What is the spring security filter? The Spring Security filter is a part of the Spring Security framework. It intercepts HTTP requests to enforce security measures, like authentication and authorization, before they reach the application.

# 11

Describe how do JWT work? JWT works by encoding JSON objects, which contain user information and other data, into a compact, URL-safe string. This string consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. It's used for secure transmission of information.

# 12

Do you use any Encoder to encode Password? Yes, in secure applications, passwords are encoded using encoders like BCrypt or Argon2. These encoders hash the password, adding a layer of security against unauthorized access.

# 13

What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider? AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?

- UserDetailService: An interface in Spring Security used to retrieve user-related data.
- AuthenticationProvider: It's responsible for authenticating users in Spring Security.
- AuthenticationManager: Manages different authentication mechanisms in Spring Security.
- AuthenticationFilter: Filters incoming requests and performs authentication.

# 14

What is the disadvantage of Session? How to overcome the disadvantage? The main disadvantage of sessions is that they can consume significant server memory with high user loads. This can be overcome by using stateless sessions, like JWT, or storing session data in a distributed cache.

# 15

How to get value from application.properties? In Spring Boot, you can use the `@Value` annotation to inject values from `application.properties` into your application code.

# 16

What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?

- `configure(HttpSecurity http)`: Configures web-based security for specific http requests.
- `configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)`: Configures authentication mechanisms, specifying how the user details are loaded and the password is encoded.

# 17

What is Spring security authentication and authorization? Spring Security authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity, while authorization is the process of determining if the authenticated user has access to certain resources or operations within the application.
