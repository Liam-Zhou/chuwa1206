### 2. What is @Configuration and @Bean?
`@Configuration` is a class-level annotation in Spring that indicates that the class has `@Bean` definition methods. So, the Spring container can process the class and generate Spring beans to be used in the application context. `@Bean` is a method-level annotation that indicates that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container.

### 3. How do you handle the exception in Spring?
Exception handling in Spring can be done using `@ControllerAdvice` or `@RestControllerAdvice` along with `@ExceptionHandler` annotations. These allow you to define global exception handling and specific handlers for certain types of exceptions that can be applied across multiple controllers.

### 4. How do you do the validations in Spring? And list some validation annotations you know.
Validation in Spring is typically accomplished using the `@Valid` annotation, often in combination with the Spring `BindingResult` object. Common JPA and Hibernate validation annotations include:
- `@NotNull`: The annotated element must not be null.
- `@NotEmpty`: The annotated element must not be empty. Supports String, Collection, Map, and Array types.
- `@Size`: The annotated element size must be within the specified boundaries.
- `@Min` and `@Max`: The annotated element has to be a number whose value must be higher or lower than the specified limit.
- `@Email`: The annotated element must be an email address.
- `@Pattern`: The annotated element must match the specified regular expression.

### 5. What is the actuator, and list some endpoints it provides?
Spring Boot Actuator is a Spring Boot sub-project that provides production-ready features to help you monitor and manage your application. Some common endpoints provided by actuator include:
- `/actuator/health`: Shows application health information.
- `/actuator/info`: Displays arbitrary application info.
- `/actuator/metrics`: Shows metrics information for the application.
- `/actuator/env`: Exposes properties from Springâ€™s `ConfigurableEnvironment`.
- `/actuator/loggers`: Shows and modifies the configuration of loggers in the application.

### 2. What is Spring and Spring Boot? What are the benefits of using Spring Boot?
Spring is a powerful, lightweight framework that provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications. Spring Boot is a project built on top of Spring that provides a simplified, opinionated way to set up and configure applications. The benefits of using Spring Boot include ease of development, reduced development time, and a greater focus on business features by providing defaults and auto-configuration options.

### 3. What is IOC and What is DI?
IOC (Inversion of Control) is a principle by which the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework. DI (Dependency Injection) is a pattern that implements IOC, where the framework injects the dependencies into components rather than the components creating dependencies themselves.

### 4. What is @ComponentScan?
`@ComponentScan` is an annotation that tells Spring where to look for annotated components. It triggers a search in the specified package and registers all Spring components found.

### 5. How to define which package Spring needs to scan in XML and annotation?
In XML configuration, you can define the packages to scan using the `<context:component-scan base-package="..."/>` tag. With annotations, you use `@ComponentScan` and specify the `basePackages` or `basePackageClasses` attribute.

### 6. What is @SpringBootApplication?
`@SpringBootApplication` is a convenience annotation in Spring Boot that combines `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan` with their default attributes.

### 7. How many ways can we define a bean?
Beans can be defined in several ways in Spring: using XML configuration files, Java Configuration (with `@Configuration` and `@Bean` annotations), and Component Scanning (`@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller` annotations).

### 8. What is the default bean name for @Component and @Bean?
For `@Component`, the default bean name is the uncapitalized version of the simple class name. For `@Bean` methods, the default bean name is the method name.

### 9. What is the difference between @Component, @Service, @Repository?
`@Component` is a generic stereotype annotation indicating a Spring-managed component. `@Service` and `@Repository` are specializations of `@Component` for service-layer components and repository-layer components (for data access), respectively, which may carry additional semantics or behaviors.

### 10. How many annotations can we use to inject the bean?
Common annotations for injecting beans include `@Autowired`, `@Inject`, `@Resource`, and constructor injection.

### 11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection (How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
Dependency injection in Spring can be done through constructor injection, setter injection, and field injection. Constructor injection is generally preferred because it allows for immutable object fields and ensures that required dependencies are not null.

### 12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one as primary? And how to let Spring pick one bean to inject if no primary?
You can annotate one of the beans with `@Primary` to indicate it as the primary bean to be injected. If there's no primary, you can use `@Qualifier` to specify which bean should be injected by its name.

### 13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
`BeanFactory` is the Spring container interface responsible for creating and managing beans. `ApplicationContext` extends `BeanFactory` and adds more enterprise-specific functionality such as easier integration with Spring's AOP features, message resource handling, and event propagation.

### 14. What is the Scope of a Bean? And list the scopes.
The scope of a bean defines the lifecycle and visibility of that bean instance within the application context. The scopes are:
- `singleton`: Only one instance per Spring container.
- `prototype`: A new instance for every bean request.
- `request`: A single instance per HTTP request.
- `session`: A single instance per HTTP session.
- `application`: A single instance per `ServletContext`.
- `websocket`: A single instance per WebSocket.

### 15. Configure a bean using XML.
To configure a bean using XML, you use the `<bean>` tag within the Spring configuration file. If the bean has dependencies, you can use the `<property>` tag for setter injection or `<constructor-arg>` for constructor injection to wire dependencies.

Example XML configuration for a bean with dependencies:

```xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <!-- Define a bean with constructor injection -->
    <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
        <constructor-arg ref="myDependency" />
    </bean>

    <!-- Define the dependency bean -->
    <bean id="myDependency" class="com.example.MyDependency"/>

    <!-- Define a bean with setter injection -->
    <bean id="myOtherBean" class="com.example.MyOtherBean">
        <property name="myDependency" ref="myDependency" />
    </bean>

</beans>
