|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@Test`              | indicates that a method is a test method                                                       |
| `@Before`            | runs before each test method, used for setup                                                   |
| `@After`             | executes after each test method, used for cleanup                                              |
| `@BeforeClass`       | runs once before any of the test methods in the class, used for static initialization          |
| `@AfterClass`        | executes once after all tests have finished. used for static cleanup                           |
| `@Ignore`            | prevents a test method from being executed                                                     |
| `@ParameterizedTest` | specifies that a method is a parametrized test, used in JUnit 5                                |
| `@RepeatedTest`      | indicates that a method is to be repeated a specified number of times                          |
| `@Test`              | marks a class or a method as part of the test                                                  |
| `@BeforeTest`        | runs before any test method belonging to the classes inside the `<test>` tag in the TestNG XML |
| `@AfterTest`         | executes after all the test methods belonging to the classes inside the `<test>` tag           |
| `@BeforeSuite`       | runs once before all tests in TestNG suite                                                     |

### Q2
it is an open-source tool for automating web browsers, primarily used for testing web applications across various platforms and browsers
### Q3
it is a tool used for running automated acceptance tests written in a behavior-driven development style
### Q4
it is an open-source application designed for performance testing and measuring the performance of various services, with a focus on web and network application
### Q5
it involves several stages
- setup `@Before`
- text execution `@Test`
- clean `@After`
- (optional) `@BeforeClass` and `@AfterClass` for one-time setup and teardown
### Q6
yes, the `@BeforeAll` method should be a static method when used in a non-nested test class
### Q7
- it is a popular Java-based mocking framework used for unit testing, it allows the creation of mock objects and the validation of interactions
- limitations
  - cannot mock private, static, or final methods
  - requires actual instantiation of classes, doesn't mock fields automatically
  - can't test mobile applications
  - struggles with mocking constructors or objects creation
- tools
  - PowerMock: helps in mocking static, private method and constructor
  - JMockit: provides more advanced mocking capabilities
  - EasyMock: an alternative for creating mock object
  - JUnit/TestNG: for structuring and executing tests alongside Mockito
### Q8
- `@Mock`: used in Mockito to create a mock object, replaces the real object with a simulated one that mimics its behavior
- `@InjectMocks`: used to create an instance of the class under test, automatically injects mock objects into it, replacing real dependencies
### Q9
it involves defining specific behaviors for mock objects, specifying how they should respond when their methods are invoked during a test
### Q10
it is used in stubbing to allow flexible verification or stubbing, enabling methods to be matched based on certain conditions or types of arguments, rather than exact values
### Q11
it is a framework used for writing matchers, which are conditions for validating objects in unit tests. it's often used with JUnit or other testing frameworks to create more readable and flexible assertions
### Q12
- `@Spy` creates a spy instance of a class, it monitors a real object and can call actual methods of the object
- Difference
  - `@Mock` creates a complete mock or fake object, all methods are stubbed and don't have original behavior
  - `@Spy` wraps a real object, meaning real methods are invoked unless explicitly stubbed
### Q13
in testing is a statement that checks if a specified condition is true or false, it's used to verify that the application behaves as expected during a test
### Q14
- unit testing: verify the correctness of individual components
- integration testing: verify that the collaboration btwn components or modules is correct
- regression testing: ensure that after changes, existing functionality is still correct
- performance testing: verify the performance and efficiency of the system ->200ms
- stress testing: ensure that system can still work normally under high pressure
- user acceptance testing: ensure that the software meets user needs and expectations
