2.  what is selenium?
    Selenium is a powerful tool for controlling web browsers through programs and performing browser automation. It is used primarily for automating web applications for testing purposes but is capable of much more.
3.  what is cucumber?
    Cucumber is a software tool that supports behavior-driven development (BDD). It allows expected software behaviors to be specified in a logical language that customers can understand, which means that non-technical folks can write the behavior scenarios.
4.  what is JMeter?
    Apache JMeter is an open-source Java application designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance. It was originally designed for testing web applications but has since expanded to other test functions.
5.  What is the lifecircle of Junit?
    The lifecycle of a JUnit test execution follows these annotated methods: @BeforeClass -> @BeforeEach -> @Test -> @AfterEach -> @AfterClass.
6.  Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
    Yes, in JUnit 5, the @BeforeAll annotated method must be static because it is executed before an instance of the test class is created.
7. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?  what kind of tools can give help?
   Mockito is a popular mocking framework for unit tests in Java. Limitations include not being able to test static, private methods, and constructor code. For these cases, tools like PowerMock can be used to extend Mockito's capabilities.
8.  What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
    @Mock is used to create a mock object to be injected.
    @InjectMocks is used to create an instance of the class and injects mocks that are created with the @Mock annotations into it.
9.  What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?
    Stubbing is a feature of mocking frameworks where you define the behavior of a mock object; what to do when certain methods are called on it.
10. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers
    Mockito ArgumentMatchers allow you to flexibly specify arguments when stubbing methods, which is particularly useful when you don't care about exact argument values.
11. what is Hamcrest Matchers
    Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects allowing 'match' rules to be defined declaratively. It is often used with JUnit and Mockito for writing assertions in a more readable and fluent style.
12. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?
    @Spy is used when you want to spy on a real object, meaning you want to call all the normal methods of the object but override some with stubbing.
    The difference is that @Mock creates a complete mock, while @Spy creates a spy that can use real methods but allows overriding.
13. What is assertion?
    In testing, an assertion is a statement that checks if a particular condition is true or false. If it's false, the test fails.
14. If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature?
    and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of
    tests?
    For a new feature, you may write several types of tests including:

Unit tests: Validate the functionality of individual components in isolation.
Integration tests: Ensure different components of the application work together as expected.
System tests: Validate the end-to-end functionality of the application.
Acceptance tests: Verify the feature against the business requirements.
