##2. what is selenium?
Selenium is a portable framework for testing web applications. It provides tools for writing functional tests without the need for learning a test scripting language. It supports multiple browsers and programming languages.

##3. what is cucumber?
Cucumber is a software tool that supports behavior-driven development (BDD). It allows the execution of feature documentation written in business-facing text.

##4. what is JMeter?
JMeter is an open-source load testing tool for analyzing and measuring the performance of a variety of services, with a focus on web applications.

##5. What is the lifecircle of Junit?
The JUnit lifecycle includes annotated methods such as @BeforeAll, @BeforeEach, @Test, @AfterEach, and @AfterAll, which run in a specific order to set up, execute, and tear down tests.

##6. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
Yes, the @BeforeAll method should be static because it runs before any test instances are created, thus it cannot access instance variables without a static context.

##7. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations? what kind of tools can give help?
Mockito is a mocking framework for unit tests in Java. Limitations include the inability to mock final classes or methods, private methods, and static methods directly. Tools like PowerMock can help overcome some of these limitations by extending the capabilities of Mockito.

##8. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
@Mock is used to create a mock object for the purpose of replacing dependencies. @InjectMocks is used to automatically inject mock fields into the tested object.

##9. What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?
Stubbing is the process of defining the behavior of a mock object; what it should return when a specific method is called.

##10. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers
ArgumentMatchers in Mockito are used to specify conditions (matchers) when defining stubbed behaviors or verifying method calls, allowing more flexible interaction with mock objects.

##11. what is Hamcrest Matchers
Hamcrest Matchers is a framework for writing matcher objects, allowing for more expressive and readable assertions in tests.

##12. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?
@Spy is used to create a spy instance. The difference between @spy and @Mock is that @spy wraps a real object and by default uses real method implementations, while @Mock creates a dummy object and stubs all methods.

##13. What is assertion?
An assertion is a statement in test code that checks if a condition is true. It's a key component in testing frameworks to validate test outcomes.

##14. If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of tests?
For a new feature, tests might include unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests. Unit tests verify individual parts in isolation, integration tests check how parts work together, and acceptance tests validate the feature against requirements. Each type ensures reliability, compatibility, and functionality of the feature.
