1. **Introduction to Selenium** Selenium is a collection of tools designed for automating web browsers. It supports multiple browsers and programming languages, enabling automated web application testing.

2. **What is Cucumber?** Cucumber is a tool that facilitates automated testing written in plain language. It utilizes the Gherkin language for test cases, bridging the gap between business and technical teams.

3. **Overview of JMeter** JMeter is an open-source tool for load testing, primarily focused on analyzing and measuring the performance of various services, especially web and network applications.

4. **JUnit Lifecycle** The lifecycle in JUnit includes methods such as `@BeforeAll`, `@BeforeEach`, `@Test`, `@AfterEach`, and `@AfterAll`, which define the setup, test execution, and teardown phases.

   - **@BeforeAll**: Runs once before all the test methods in the class.
   - **@BeforeEach**: Runs before each test method.
   - **@Test**: The actual testing method.
   - **@AfterEach**: Runs after each test method.
   - **@AfterAll**: Runs once after all test methods are executed.

5. **Should the `@BeforeAll` Method be Class Level (static)?** Yes, `@BeforeAll` is typically static as it runs once before all tests in the class, necessitating a class-level scope.

6. **What is Mockito and its Limitations?** Mockito is a mocking framework for Java unit tests. Its limitations include the inability to mock private methods, final classes, or static methods directly. Tools like PowerMock are used in conjunction for such scenarios.

7. **What are `@Mock` and `@InjectMocks`?** `@Mock` is used to create mock instances of classes. `@InjectMocks` creates an instance of a class and injects the mocks created with `@Mock` into it.

   Example Code:

   ```java
   javaCopy code
   @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
   public class UserServiceTest {
   
       @Mock
       private UserRepository userRepository;
   
       @InjectMocks
       private UserService userService;
   
       @Test
       public void testFindUserByEmail() {
           // Set up our mock repository
           String email = "user@example.com";
           User mockUser = new User(email);
           when(userRepository.findByEmail(anyString())).thenReturn(mockUser);
   
           // Execute the service call
           User returnedUser = userService.findUserByEmail(email);
   
           // Assert the response
           assertNotNull(returnedUser);
           assertEquals(email, returnedUser.getEmail());
       }
   }
   ```

8. **What is Stubbing (Define Behaviors)?** Stubbing defines the behavior of mocks, determining return values or actions in response to method calls during tests.

9. **What are Mockito ArgumentMatchers?** ArgumentMatchers in Mockito allow for specifying flexible argument conditions when stubbing methods, enabling mocks to respond to a broader range of inputs.

10. **What are Hamcrest Matchers?** Hamcrest Matchers are a library of matcher objects for asserting conditions in tests, offering readable and flexible test assertions.

11. **Do You Know `@Spy`? What is the Difference Between `@Spy` and `@Mock`?** `@Spy` partially mocks an object, spying on real methods unless overridden. `@Mock` creates a complete mock. `@Spy` is used for real objects with some behavior overridden.

12. **What is an Assertion?** Assertions are statements in test code used to verify if the test conditions meet the expected outcomes, ensuring correctness.

13. **If You Develop a New Feature, What Types of Tests Would You Conduct?** Testing types include unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and acceptance tests, each serving different purposes from verifying small units to entire system workflows.
