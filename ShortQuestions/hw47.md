2. Selenium is an open-source software framework commonly used in computer science and automation testing. It provides a suite of tools and libraries for automating web browsers, allowing developers and testers to interact with web applications programmatically. Selenium is often used for tasks like web scraping, testing web applications, and automating repetitive browser actions.

3. Cucumber is a computer science tool used for behavior-driven development (BDD). It allows teams to write executable specifications in plain text, which can be understood by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Cucumber tests are written in a natural language format, making it easier to bridge the communication gap between developers and business stakeholders in software development projects. It's often used in conjunction with programming languages like Java and Ruby to automate testing scenarios based on these specifications.

4. JMeter is a computer science tool used for performance testing and load testing of applications. It allows testers to simulate multiple users and their interactions with a web application, helping to assess its performance under different conditions. JMeter is widely used in the field of software testing and quality assurance to identify bottlenecks and issues related to an application's scalability and performance.

5. The lifecycle 

   1. Setup: In this phase, resources and initial conditions for testing are prepared. This typically involves creating objects and initializing variables required for the test.
   2. Execution: The actual test methods are executed during this phase. JUnit runs the test methods defined in your test classes and checks if they produce the expected results.
   3. Assertion: During this stage, assertions are used to compare the expected outcomes with the actual results obtained from the test execution. If assertions fail, the test is considered unsuccessful.
   4. Verify: In the final phase, resources and objects created in the setup phase are cleaned up to ensure a clean and consistent state for subsequent tests. This step is essential for maintaining the integrity of the testing environment.

6. Yes.

7. Mockito is a widely used computer science library for Java that helps in creating and managing mock objects for testing purposes. It allows developers to simulate the behavior of dependencies or external components in a controlled and predictable way during unit testing. Mockito is particularly helpful in isolating the code being tested and ensuring that it functions correctly in isolation.

   Limitations of Mockito:

   1. Cannot mock final classes or methods.
   2. Limited support for mocking static or private methods.
   3. Mocking of some complex data types or third-party libraries may require additional configurations.
   4. Mockito cannot mock certain types of system classes and final methods, which can be a limitation in certain scenarios.

   Tools that can help overcome some of these limitations include PowerMock and JMockit, which provide more advanced mocking capabilities, including mocking of final classes and methods, and static methods. However, these tools may come with their own learning curves and trade-offs, so choosing the right tool depends on your specific testing needs and project requirements.

8. `@Mock`: This annotation is used to create mock objects for the dependencies of the class under test. It helps in isolating the class being tested by replacing its dependencies with mock objects.

   `@InjectMocks`: This annotation is used to inject the mock objects created with `@Mock` into the class under test. It tells Mockito to automatically inject the mock dependencies into the instance of the class being tested.

9. Stubbing, in the context of mocking and testing, refers to defining the expected behavior or responses of a mock object when specific methods are called. It involves setting up predefined return values or actions that the mock object should perform when certain method calls occur during a test. This allows developers to simulate the behavior of dependencies or external components in a controlled and predictable manner, making it easier to test the interactions and functionality of the code being tested.

10. Mockito ArgumentMatchers are utility methods provided by the Mockito framework in computer science for defining flexible and expressive argument matching during method calls on mock objects. They allow you to specify the expected arguments or parameters for a method call on a mock object in a way that makes your test assertions more flexible and adaptable. ArgumentMatchers enable you to define conditions such as matching any value, specific values, or more complex matching rules, making it easier to verify interactions and behavior in your unit tests.

11. Hamcrest Matchers are a framework used in software testing, particularly for writing matchers that allow for more readable and flexible assertions. Originating from the Java world, they have implementations in various programming languages. Hamcrest enables developers to write descriptive test statements that read more like natural language, making tests easier to understand and maintain. Matchers are used to assert conditions in tests, such as whether a value is equal to another, if a collection contains an item, or if a string matches a pattern. This framework supports a wide range of built-in matchers and allows for custom matcher creation to suit specific testing needs.

12. Yes. @Spy will use the original method if no mock is found. However, @Mock will return null if corresponding behavior is found.

13. It is  a statement or piece of code that checks if a certain condition or expectation holds true during the execution of a program or a test. It is used to verify that the actual result or behavior matches the expected result or behavior. If the assertion condition is true, the program or test continues to execute without any issues. If the condition is false, it typically triggers an error or failure, indicating that something unexpected has occurred, helping identify and diagnose issues in the code. Assertions are essential for ensuring the correctness and reliability of software.

14. Unit test. Integration test. Regression test. Performance Test. Stress Test. UAT.

    As a developer, I need to do the unit test and the integration test.
