### 2. what is selenium?

> Selenium is a user-behavior simulation tool, consist of WebDriver: a driver to help grab web elements and Page Objects: a java class to simulate a web page.

### 3. what is cucumber?

> Cucumber is an open-source testing tool that supports behavior-driven development (BDD).  It allows developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders to collaborate on the creation and execution of test scenarios in a human-readable format. The primary purpose of Cucumber is to bridge the communication gap between technical and non-technical team members by expressing test scenarios in a natural language format.

### 4. what is JMeter?

> Java-based software tool designed for performance testing, load testing, and functional testing of web applications.

### 5. What is the lifecircle of Junit?

> Class Level Setup -> Setup -> Test Execution -> Cleanup -> Class Level Cleanup
>
> @BeforeAll             @BeforeEach  @Test               @AfterEach   @AfterAll

### 6. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?

> Yesm @BeforeAll annotation is used to mark a method that should be executed before all test methods in a test class.  Making it `static` ensures that it can be invoked without creating an instance of the test class, allowing it to perform class-level setup.

### 7.  What is Mockito? and what is its limitations? what kind of tools can give help?

> **Mockito** is an open-source testing framework for Java that allows the creation of mock objects in unit tests. Mock objects are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects, but their responses are controlled and configured by the test developer. 
>
> Limitations: 
>
> Mockito does not support mocking static methods. 
>
> Mockito cannot mock final classes or methods.
>
> Mockito has limited support for mocking private methods. While it's possible to partially mock an object using `@Spy`, private method mocking is not as straightforward.
>
> Use **PowerMockito** to overcome the problems of Mockito, such as the lack of ability to mock final, static or private methods.

### 8. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?

> - `@Mock` is used to annotate a field in a test class to create a mock object.
> - The annotated field will be automatically instantiated as a mock object during the test setup.
> - The mock object can then be configured to simulate the behavior of a real object.

> - `@InjectMocks` is used to annotate a field in a test class where the actual object (not a mock) needs to be injected.
> - The fields annotated with `@Mock` are injected into the field annotated with `@InjectMocks`.
> - Mockito attempts to inject the mocks into the real object automatically.

### 9. What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?

> Stubbing in the context of testing refers to the process of defining behaviors for mock objects. When you create a mock object, it initially has no predefined behavior. Stubbing allows you to specify what a method on the mock object should return when it's invoked during a test. In other words, stubbing sets up the expected behavior of the mock.

### 10. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers

> Mockito ArgumentMatchers are utilities provided by the Mockito framework to make it easier to match and work with method arguments when setting up behavior for mocked objects. These argument matchers allow you to specify flexible conditions for the parameters passed to mocked methods during stubbing and verification.

### 11. what is Hamcrest Matchers

> Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects in Java. Matchers are objects that allow you to specify or verify the expected behavior of your code in a human-readable and expressive manner. Hamcrest provides a set of matchers that can be used with various testing frameworks, including JUnit and TestNG. These matchers enhance the readability of assertions in your test code.
>
> 1. **Readable Syntax:**
>    - Hamcrest matchers aim to provide a readable and fluent syntax for assertions in tests.
>    - The structure of the assertions reads like natural language, making it easier to understand the intent of the test.
> 2. **Integration with Testing Frameworks:**
>    - Hamcrest is designed to integrate seamlessly with popular testing frameworks like JUnit, TestNG, and others.
>    - It provides a set of matchers that can be used directly in assertion statements within your test methods.
> 3. **Matcher Combinators:**
>    - Hamcrest matchers can be combined using various combinator methods to create more complex and flexible assertions.
>    - Combinators include `allOf`, `anyOf`, `not`, and others, allowing you to build powerful conditions.
> 4. **Type-Safe Matchers:**
>    - Hamcrest matchers are type-safe, meaning that they are designed to work with specific types, preventing mismatches and improving the safety of your tests.
> 5. **Custom Matchers:**
>    - Hamcrest allows you to create custom matchers tailored to your specific needs.
>    - Custom matchers can be useful when the built-in matchers don't cover the exact conditions you want to test.

```java
import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
// a simple example of using Hamcrest matchers in a JUnit test:
public class ExampleHamcrestTest {

    @Test
    public void testWithHamcrestMatchers() {
        String actualString = "Hello, Hamcrest!";
        int actualNumber = 42;

        // Using Hamcrest matchers for assertions
        assertThat(actualString, containsString("Hamcrest"));
        assertThat(actualNumber, equalTo(42));
        assertThat(actualNumber, greaterThan(30));
    }
}

```

### 12. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?

> **`@Mock`:**
>
> - The `@Mock` annotation is used to create a mock object for a class or interface.
> - Mock objects created with `@Mock` have all their methods mocked by default, and their default behavior is usually to return default values (e.g., `null`, `0`, `false`, etc.).
> - You explicitly specify the behavior of methods using the `when` and `thenReturn` methods.

> **`@Spy`:**
>
> - The `@Spy` annotation is used to create a partial mock, which means that it allows you to partially mock a real object while retaining the original behavior of certain methods.
> - Unlike `@Mock`, when you use `@Spy`, the real methods of the object are invoked unless they are explicitly stubbed.

### 13.  What is assertion?

> is a statement or expression that checks whether a given condition or expected behavior holds true. Assertions are used to verify that the actual outcome of a test matches the expected result.
