2. Selenium is an open source umbrella project for a range of tools and libraries aimed at supporting browser automation. It provides a playback tool for authoring functional tests across most modern web browsers, without the need to learn a test scripting language.

3. Cucumber is a software tool that supports behavior-driven development. Central to the Cucumber BDD approach is its ordinary language parser called Gherkin. It allows expected software behaviors to be specified in a logical language that customers can understand.

4. Apache JMeter is an Apache project that can be used as a load testing tool for analyzing and measuring the performance of a variety of services, with a focus on web applications.

7. Mockito is a Java-based framework used for unit testing of Java applications. This mocking framework helps in the development of testable applications. You use Java Reflection API internally to generate mock objects.

   Mockito cannot mock final, static and private methods.

   Use PowerMockito

8. @Mock marks a field to be mock object. @InjectMocks mark a field on which injection should be performed.

9. Stubbing is mock method.

10. ArgumentMatchers allow us flexible verification or stubbing. Any argument that matchs the type which ArgumentMatchers indicate will be handled by mockito.

11. Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects allowing ‘match’ rules to be defined declaratively.

12. @Spy allows you to partially mock an object. When unmocked methods are called, the original methods are called.

    When unmocked method is called on @Mock object, it will do nothing or return default value.

13. In computer programming, specifically when using the imperative programming paradigm, an assertion is a predicate (a Boolean-valued function over the state space, usually expressed as a logical proposition using the variables of a program) connected to a point in the program, that always should evaluate to true at that point in code execution.

14. - unit tests, integeration test, performance test, stress test, user acceptance test.
    - Unit tests
    - Purpose:
      - unit test: verify the correctness of individual components
      - integration test: verify that the collaboration between components or modules is correct.
      - regression test: ensure that after changes, existing functionality is still correct
      - performance test: verify the performance and efficiency of the system.
      - Stress test: ensure that the system can still work normally under high pressure.
      - user acceptance test: ensure that the software meets user needs and expectations.
