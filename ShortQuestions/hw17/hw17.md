Document the microservice architeture and components/tools/dependencies

Microservice architecture involves structuring an application as a collection of small, autonomous services modeled around a business domain. Key components include Containers for encapsulation, Clustering and Orchestration for management, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for infrastructure setup, Cloud Infrastructure for scalability, API Gateways for interfacing, and Service Discovery for locating services. Common tools include Docker for containerization, Wiremock for simulating HTTP-based APIs, and Hystrix for latency and fault tolerance.



# 3

What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?

Resilience patterns in microservices are strategies to handle and recover from failures, ensuring system stability and reliability. The circuit breaker pattern is a resilience strategy that prevents a network or service failure from cascading to other parts of the system. It does this by monitoring for failures and, once a threshold is reached, "trips" to stop further failures, allowing the system to recover or redirect traffic until the issue is resolved.

Explain continuous monitoring. Continuous monitoring in microservices involves the ongoing observation and analysis of the operational state and performance of services to identify and address issues proactively, ensuring system reliability and security.

What do you mean by Domain driven design? Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that focuses on complex needs by connecting the implementation to an evolving model of the core business concepts, facilitating collaboration between technical and domain experts to solve domain problems.

What are Reactive Extensions in Microservices? Reactive Extensions (Rx) in microservices refer to a programming model for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences, enabling efficient handling of streams of data and events with minimal resource consumption.

Explain Container in Microservices. Containers in microservices are lightweight, executable units of software that package code and all its dependencies, ensuring that the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another, facilitating microservices' deployment and scalability.

how to do load balance in microservice? Write a long Summary by yourself.

- **Round Robin**: Distributes requests sequentially across all servers.
- **Least Connections**: Prefers servers with the fewest active connections.
- **IP Hash**: Routes requests based on the hash of the client's IP address, ensuring a user consistently reaches the same server.

#### Service Discovery Integration

In dynamic environments, especially those hosted on cloud platforms, service instances can change rapidly. Integrating load balancing with service discovery mechanisms allows the load balancer to query a service registry to route traffic to healthy, available instances. This setup is crucial for microservices architecture, where services may be scaled up or down frequently.

#### Health Checks

Regular health checks are essential to ensure traffic is only directed to operational service instances. Load balancers continuously monitor the health of all instances and remove unhealthy ones from the pool, rerouting traffic to the remaining healthy instances.

#### SSL Termination

For secure applications, SSL termination at the load balancer can offload cryptographic operations from the service instances, improving performance. The load balancer decrypts incoming SSL/TLS connections and forwards plain traffic to the backend services, handling encryption for outgoing traffic.

#### Session Persistence

Certain applications require that a user's session be handled by the same service instance for the duration of their visit. Techniques like cookie-based session persistence or IP hashing ensure that requests from the same session are consistently routed to the same instance.





# 6

How to do service discovery?



Service discovery in microservices involves automatically detecting and cataloging services within a system, allowing services to find and communicate with each other. It typically uses a dedicated service registry, where services register themselves upon startup and deregister upon shutdown. Clients or other services query the registry to find the network locations of available service instances, enabling dynamic, flexible communication within microservice architectures.

What are the major components of Kafka? Kafka's major components include Producers, which publish data to topics; Consumers, which read data from topics; Brokers, which store data; Topics, which categorize data; and Partitions, which allow data parallelism.

# 8

What do you mean by a Partition in Kafka? A Partition in Kafka is a division of a topic for scalability and parallel processing. It allows multiple consumers to read from a topic in parallel, enhancing throughput. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records.

# 9

What do you mean by zookeeper in Kafka and what are its uses? Zookeeper in Kafka manages cluster configuration and synchronization. It maintains the list of Kafka brokers, topics, partitions, and their status. Zookeeper's role is critical for distributed coordination, ensuring high availability and consistency.

# 10

Can we use Kafka without Zookeeper? Historically, Kafka required Zookeeper for broker coordination and cluster metadata, but Kafka version 2.8 and later introduced KIP-500, enabling Kafka to run without Zookeeper by using an internal Raft protocol for consensus.

# 11

Explain the concept of Leader and Follower in Kafka. In Kafka, each partition has one leader and multiple followers. The leader handles all read and write requests for the partition, while followers replicate the leader's data. This design ensures data durability and availability.

# 12

Why is Topic Replication important in Kafka? What do you mean by ISR in Kafka? Topic replication in Kafka ensures data availability and fault tolerance. ISR, or In-Sync Replicas, refers to the set of follower partitions that have fully replicated the leader's log. It's crucial for maintaining data integrity and consistency.

# 13

What do you understand about a consumer group in Kafka? A consumer group in Kafka is a group of consumers acting as a single logical subscriber. They share a group ID and work together to consume data from different partitions of the same topic, enabling parallel processing and fault tolerance.

# 14

How do you start a Kafka server? Starting a Kafka server involves launching the Kafka broker instance using the `kafka-server-start.sh` script followed by the `server.properties` configuration file. This initializes the Kafka service on the specified port and binds it to the configured listeners.

# 15

Tell me about some of the real-world usages of Apache Kafka. Apache Kafka is used for building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications, for real-time analytics, monitoring, log aggregation, event sourcing, and messaging in various domains like finance, social media, and e-commerce.

# 16

Describe partitioning key in Kafka. A partitioning key in Kafka determines the specific partition within a topic where a record should be sent. It ensures that records with the same key are sent to the same partition, enabling message ordering and consistency for those records.

# 17

What is the purpose of partitions in Kafka? Partitions in Kafka enable the parallel processing of data, increase scalability, and enhance fault tolerance by distributing data across multiple brokers. They allow multiple consumers to read from a topic simultaneously, increasing throughput.

# 18

Differentiate between Rabbitmq and Kafka. RabbitMQ is a message broker that specializes in complex routing, message queuing, and delivery confirmations, focusing on point-to-point, request/reply, and pub-sub messaging patterns. Kafka is designed for high-throughput, persistent, and scalable event streaming, excelling in log aggregation, stream processing, and real-time analytics.

# 19

What are the guarantees that Kafka provides? Kafka guarantees message durability, high availability through replication, at-least-once delivery by default, and the possibility of exactly-once delivery semantics with proper configuration. It ensures ordered message processing within a partition.

# 20

What do you mean by an unbalanced cluster in Kafka? How can you balance it? An unbalanced cluster in Kafka means that some brokers have a higher load than others, affecting performance. Balancing can be achieved by redistributing partitions and replicas across the cluster, using Kafka's reassignment tools or automated rebalancing features in newer versions.

# 21

In your recent project, are you a producer or consumer or both? In my recent project, I functioned as both a producer and a consumer. As a producer, I published messages to specific topics, and as a consumer, I subscribed to various topics to process incoming data, demonstrating the dual capability in Kafka's ecosystem.

# 22

In your recent project, Could you tell me your topic name? In my recent project, the primary topic name was "transaction_events," which was used for publishing transaction-related events such as payments, transfers, and withdrawals, facilitating real-time processing and analytics.

# 23

In your recent project, How many brokers do you have? How many partitions for each topic? How many data for each topic. In my recent project, we utilized a Kafka cluster with 3 brokers to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Each critical topic, like "transaction_events," was configured with 12 partitions to balance load and enhance parallel processing. The data volume varied, with millions of messages processed daily.

# 24

In my recent project, the marketing team produced user engagement events, such as clicks and views, which were published to the "user_engagement" topic. My team produced system metrics and operational events, contributing to the "system_metrics" topic, aiding in monitoring and analysis.

# 25

What is offset? An offset in Kafka is a sequential id assigned to records as they are appended to a partition. It marks the position of each record within the partition, allowing consumers to track their progress and resume consumption from the last read position, ensuring no data loss or duplication.
