# 2

What is Selenium? Selenium is an open-source automation framework for web browsers, enabling developers to write tests in multiple programming languages to automate web application testing across various browsers and operating systems.

# 3

What is Cucumber? Cucumber is a software tool used for testing other software. It runs automated acceptance tests written in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style.

# 4

What is JMeter? JMeter is an open-source load testing tool for analyzing and measuring the performance of a variety of services, with a focus on web applications.

# 5

What is the lifecycle of JUnit? The lifecycle of JUnit includes annotated methods that run in a specific order: @BeforeAll, @BeforeEach, @Test, @AfterEach, and @AfterAll, facilitating setup and teardown for test methods.

# 6

Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level (static)? Yes, the @BeforeAll method should be static because it runs before all test methods in the class and is executed once, requiring no instance of the class.

# 7

What is Mockito? What are its limitations? What kind of tools can help? Mockito is a mocking framework for unit tests in Java, allowing the simulation of external dependencies. Limitations include the inability to mock final classes, private methods, and the need for clear dependency injection for effectiveness. Tools like PowerMock can help overcome some of Mockito's limitations by extending its capabilities to mock static and private methods.

# 8

What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks? @Mock is an annotation used to create a mock object for the purpose of isolating test units by replacing dependencies with objects that simulate the behavior of the real dependencies. @InjectMocks is used to automatically inject mock fields into the tested object.

# 9

What is stubbing (define behaviors)? Stubbing is a feature in mocking frameworks where developers can define the behavior of mock objects, specifying what return values should be given in response to specific method calls.

# 10

What is Mockito ArgumentMatchers? Mockito ArgumentMatchers allow specifying flexible argument matching in stubbing or verification, enabling mocks to respond to a wider range of inputs than exact matches.

# 11

What is Hamcrest Matchers? Hamcrest Matchers are a library of matcher objects used for writing match rules in tests, allowing for more readable and flexible assertions in unit tests.

# 12

Do you know @Spy? What is the difference between @Spy and @Mock? @Spy is used to create a spy instance of a real object where you can stub out some methods but still use the real object's behavior. The difference between @Spy and @Mock is that @Mock creates a complete mock or dummy object, whereas @Spy wraps a real object, spying on actual calls but allowing for method stubbing.

# 13

What is assertion? An assertion is a statement in test code that checks if a specific condition is true. It's used to verify that the application behaves as expected during a test.

# 14

If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? What kind of tests are written by you? What is the purpose of each type of tests? For a new feature, various types of tests include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Unit tests verify individual components for correctness, integration tests check the interaction between components, and end-to-end tests validate the entire application flow. The purpose is to ensure reliability, performance, and user experience meet the requirements.
