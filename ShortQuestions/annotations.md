Sure, here is the translation of the provided annotations into English:

```plaintext
@Component
Indicates that a class annotated with it is a "component" and becomes a Spring-managed bean. When using annotation-based configuration and classpath scanning, these classes are considered automatically detected candidates. Additionally, @Component is also a meta-annotation.

@Service
A composed annotation (composed of @Component) used in the service layer (business logic layer).

@Repository
A composed annotation (composed of @Component) used in the data access layer (data access layer).

@Controller
A composed annotation (composed of @Component) used in the MVC layer (controller layer). DispatcherServlet automatically scans classes annotated with this annotation and maps web requests to methods annotated with @RequestMapping.

@RequestMapping
Used to map web requests, including defining the access path and parameters (can be applied to classes or methods).

@ResponseBody
Supports placing the return value directly in the response body instead of rendering a page. Typically used for returning JSON data (applied next to the return value or at the method level).

@RequestBody
Allows request parameters to be in the request body instead of directly attached to the URL. Applied to method parameters.

@PathVariable
Used to receive path parameters, e.g., when declaring paths with @RequestMapping("/hello/{name}"). Place the annotation in front of the parameter to retrieve its value, often used for implementing Restful interfaces.

@RestController
A composed annotation (combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody). Applied at the class level, meaning that all methods in this controller are, by default, annotated with @ResponseBody.

@ExceptionHandler
Used to globally handle exceptions in controllers.

@ModelAttribute
Originally used to bind key-value pairs to the Model. In @ControllerAdvice, it makes key-value pairs set here globally available to all @RequestMapping methods.

@Autowired
Spring's tool for automatic dependency injection. Automatically injected by Spring's dependency injection tools (BeanPostProcessor, BeanFactoryPostProcessor).

@Configuration
Declares the current class as a configuration class, equivalent to a Spring configuration XML file (applied at the class level).

@Bean
An annotation applied to a method, declaring that the method's return value is a bean. The returned bean class can define init() and destroy() methods, which are executed after construction and before destruction, respectively (applied at the method level).

@ComponentScan
Automatically scans all classes in the specified package using @Service, @Component, @Controller, and @Repository annotations, and registers them (applied at the class level).

@Aspect
Declares an aspect (applied at the class level). Uses @After, @Before, @Around to define advice, and the interception rules (pointcuts) are passed as parameters.

@After: Executed after the method.
@Before: Executed before the method.
@Around: Executed before and after the method.
@Pointcut: Declares a pointcut.
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy
Used in a Java configuration class to enable Spring's support for AspectJ proxies (applied at the class level).

@Scope
Defines the mode used to create a bean (applied at the method level, in conjunction with @Bean). Possible types include:
- Singleton: A single bean instance for the entire Spring container (default mode).
- Prototype: A new bean instance for each call.
- Request: A new bean instance for each HTTP request (web projects).
- Session: A new bean instance for each HTTP session (web projects).
- GlobalSession: A new bean instance for each global HTTP session (web projects).

@PostConstruct
Applied to a method, indicating that the method should be executed after construction.

@PreDestroy
Applied to a method, indicating that the method should be executed before the object is destroyed.

@Value
Often used with Spring Expression Language (SpEL) to inject plain characters, system properties, expression results, other bean properties, file contents, web request contents, or configuration file properties.

@EnableAsync
Applied at the class level in a configuration class, enabling support for asynchronous tasks by implementing the AsyncConfigurer interface.

@Async
Applied to methods in actual beans to declare them as asynchronous tasks (applied at the method level or on all methods in a class if @EnableAsync is used to enable asynchronous tasks).

@EnableScheduling
Used in a configuration class, enabling support for scheduled tasks (applied at the class level).

@Scheduled
Declares a method as a scheduled task, including cron, fixDelay, fixRate, etc. (applied at the method level, requires enabling scheduled task support).

@Enable*
Annotations that indicate enabling support for specific features. For example:
- @EnableAspectJAutoProxy: Enables support for AspectJ auto-proxy.
- @EnableAsync: Enables support for asynchronous methods.
- @EnableScheduling: Enables support for scheduled tasks.
- @EnableWebMvc: Enables Web MVC configuration support.
- @EnableConfigurationProperties: Enables support for @ConfigurationProperties annotated configuration beans.
- @EnableJpaRepositories: Enables support for Spring Data JPA repositories.
- @EnableTransactionManagement: Enables annotation-driven transaction management.
- @EnableTransactionManagement: Enables annotation-driven transaction management.
- @EnableCaching: Enables annotation-driven caching.
