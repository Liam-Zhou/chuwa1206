# `@SpringBootApplication`
> The @SpringBootApplication annotation is equivalent to using @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan with their default attributes. Spring Boot enables the developer to use a single annotation instead of using multiple. But, as we know, Spring provided loosely coupled features that we can use for each annotation as per our project needs
> 
   A single @SpringBootApplication annotation can be used to enable those three features, that is:

- @EnableAutoConfiguration: enable Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration mechanism
- @ComponentScan: enable @Component scan on the package where the application is located (see the best practices)
- @Configuration: allow to register extra beans in the context or import additional configuration classes
```java
package com.example.myapplication;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication // same as @Configuration @EnableAutoConfiguration @ComponentScan
public class Application {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
	}

}
```


# @Table
> `@Table` annotation provides options to customize the mapping of an entity to a database table
```java
@Table(
        name = "post",
        uniqueConstraints = {
                @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = {"title"})
        }
)
```

# @Column
> When you use @Column annotation without specifying the name attribute, the default behavior is that the column name in the database will be derived from the field name in the entity class


# @Bean
> The @Bean annotation returns an object that spring should register as bean in application context. The body of the method bears the logic responsible for creating the instance.

# @Entity
> `@Entity` to flag your Pojo as JPA or Spring Data managed bean to read or write it to a database. help map our domain objects (POJOs) to the relational database table

# @Component
> `@Component` is a class that is eligible to be scanned by Spring's auto-detection for dependency injection

# @Repository
> Handle all DataAccessExceptions differently to a general Throwable type

# @Service
> Used to annotate classes that provide business services or service-related functionality.

# @Controller
> the @Controller annotation is typically used in UI-based applications where the response is generally an HTML page

# @ResponseBody
> The @ResponseBody annotation indicates a method return value should be bound to the web response body

# @RestController
> is used in the case of REST style controllers i.e. handler methods shall return the JSON/XML response directly to the client rather than using view resolvers. The @RestController is a convenience annotation that combines the @Controller and @ResponseBody annotations.

# @Autowired
> Is used to automatically inject dependencies into a Spring bean. When you mark a field, constructor, or a method with @Autowired, the Spring framework automatically resolves and provides the necessary dependencies at runtime. 

# @PostMapping
> Is used to map HTTP POST requests to a specific handler method in a controller. When you annotate a method with @PostMapping and specify a URL path, the method will be invoked when an HTTP POST request is sent to that path.

# @RequestBody
> When you use @RequestBody with a method parameter, Spring Boot automatically converts the content of the request body (usually in JSON or XML format) into the corresponding Java object.
