1. list all of the new annotations you learned to your annotations.md
2. Document the microservice architecture and components/tools/dependencies

   - Spring Cloud
   - Gateway: Zuul API Gateway, Spring Cloud Gateway
   - Service Registry: Eureka, Consul
   - Load Balancer: Ribbon Load Balancer
   - Circuit Breaker: Hystrix Circuit Breaker
   - Config Center: Spring Cloud Config Center
   - Message Queue: Kafka
   - Docker

3. What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?

   Resilience pattern is a set of mechanism used in microservice architectures to empower applications to manage failure gracefully and ensure the stability of complex, distributed system.

   When a service request fails repeatedly, the circuit breaker will open and stop all calls to that service. When the service recovers, the circuit breaker closes the circuit and restores connection and service.

4. Read this article, then list the important questions, then write your answers

   a. https://www.interviewbit.com/microservices-interview-questions/#main-features-of-microservices

   - How independent microservices communicate with each other?
     - HTTP/REST with JSON for request-response.
     - Websocket for streaming
     - Message queue
   - What do you mean by end-to-end microservices testing
     - It is a technique to ensure that all components work together and all processes in the work flow works properly. It is usually done through user interface, mimicking how it appears to the user.

5. how to do load balance in microservice? Write a long Summary by yourself.

   a. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/load-balancer-system-design-interview-question/

   b. https://www.fullstack.cafe/blog/load-balancing-interview-questions

   There are multiple places where we can do load balancing. We can do it between users and application, between application and services, and between services and databases.

   Load balancing is a way to keep fair loading between servers by sending traffic to appropriate node.

   There are also different methods to implement load balancing: round robin, weighted round robin, least connection method, least response time method, source IP hash, and power of two random choices.

   Load balancing is important to applications with heavy workload and in need to spread traffic evenly among the nodes.

6. How to do service discovery?

   When a service is up, it registers itself to the service registry such as Eureka to let other service calls the service. When a service leaves the system, it moves itself from the registry.
