package takes the compiled code and packages it into its distributable format, such as a JAR. install takes the package and places it in your local Maven repository, making it available for use as a dependency in other projects on your system.

Maven plugins are components that extend Maven's capabilities. Examples include maven-compiler-plugin, maven-surefire-plugin, and maven-jar-plugin.
