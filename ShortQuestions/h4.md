1. What is generic in Java?

Generics in Java are a feature that allows us to write code with type parameters. This means we can define classes, interfaces, and methods where the type of data they operate on is specified as a parameter. Using generics enhances type safety, as it enables the compiler to catch type mismatches during compilation and reduces the need for type casting.

5. Write the Singleton design pattern include eager load and lazy load.  

public class LazySingleton {
    private static LazySingleton instance;

    private LazySingleton() {
    }

    public static LazySingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new LazySingleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

public class ThreadSafeLazySingleton {
    private static volatile ThreadSafeLazySingleton instance;

    private ThreadSafeLazySingleton() {
    }

    public static ThreadSafeLazySingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (ThreadSafeLazySingleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new ThreadSafeLazySingleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

6. What is Runtime Exception? could you give me some examples? 

A RuntimeException in Java is a type of unchecked exception, meaning it does not need to be declared in a method's throws clause. They usually indicate programming bugs, such as logic errors or improper use of an API. 
Examples: NullPointerException; ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException; IllegalArgumentException

7. Could you give me one example of NullPointerException? 

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = null;
        int length = text.length(); // This line will throw NullPointerException. Because we cannot call a method on a null reference.
    }
}

8. What is the Optional class

The Optional class in Java is a container object which may or may not contain a non-null value. Introduced in Java 8, it is used to represent optional values that are either present or absent. This class was designed to provide a more expressive, less error-prone alternative to null references and to help avoid NullPointerException.

9. What are the advantages of using the Optional class? 

Better Null Handling: It reduces NullPointerException risks by explicitly handling nulls.
Improved Readability: Makes it clear when values may be absent, enhancing code clarity.
Functional Style: Supports functional programming methods like map, filter, improving expressiveness.
Explicit Null Checks: Forces handling of potential null cases, leading to more robust code.

10. What is the @FunctionalInterface? 

The @FunctionalInterface annotation in Java is used to indicate that an interface is intended to be a functional interface. Functional interfaces have a single abstract method and are used as the basis for lambda expressions in Java 8 and beyond.

11. what is lamda? 

A lambda expression in Java is a concise way to represent an anonymous function that can be passed around.

12. What is Method Reference?
    
It is a shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method. A concise way to refer to a method without executing it and useful for expressing lambda expressions that do nothing but call an existing method. They make the code more readable and succinct.

13. What is Java 8 new features? 

Lambda Expressions
Stream API
Method References
Functional Interfaces
Default and Static Methods in Interfaces
New Date-Time API
Optional class
Nashorn JavaScript Engine

14. Lambda can use unchanged variable outside of lambda? what is the details?

Lambda expressions can capture and use final or effectively final variables from their enclosing scope.
15. Describe the newly added features in Java 8?
Lambda expressions in Java 8 are a significant feature that enable a clear and concise way to represent one method interface using an expression. They are especially useful in collections and stream API for filtering, iterating, and transforming data.

The Stream API in Java 8 allows for declarative processing of collections (and other data structures) in a functional style. It provides methods for parallel and sequential processing of large datasets.

16. Can a functional interface extend/inherit another interface?

A functional interface can extend another interface only if it does not have any abstract method.

17. What is the lambda expression in Java and How does a lambda expression relate to a functional interface?

A lambda expression in Java is a concise way to represent an anonymous function that can be passed around. Lambda expressions provide implementation of the abstract method of a functional interface.

18. In Java 8, what is Method Reference?

It is a shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method. A concise way to refer to a method without executing it and useful for expressing lambda expressions that do nothing but call an existing method. They make the code more readable and succinct.

19. What does the String::ValueOf expression mean?

Method reference to String.valueOf method, used to convert objects to strings.

20. What are Intermediate and Terminal operations?

Intermediate operations return a stream and are lazy.
Terminal operations produce a result or side-effect and terminate the stream.

21. What are the most commonly used Intermediate operations?

map, filter, sorted, distinct, limit

22. What is the difference between findFirst() and findAny()?

findFirst returns the first element, useful for ordered streams.
findAny returns any element, beneficial for performance in parallel operations.

23. How are Collections different from Stream?

Collections are about data storage and retrieval.
Streams are about computations on data, focusing on expressing what to compute rather than how to compute.
