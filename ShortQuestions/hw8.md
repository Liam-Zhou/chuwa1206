# debug in springboot
1. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Debugging:

Most Java IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Spring Tool Suite (STS) have built-in debugging capabilities.
You can set breakpoints in your code where you want the execution to pause. When you run your application in debug mode, the execution will stop at these breakpoints, allowing you to inspect variables, evaluate expressions, and step through the code.
2. Logging:

Proper logging is crucial for understanding what's happening in your application. Spring Boot uses Commons Logging for all internal logging but leaves the underlying log implementation open. Default configurations are provided for Java Util Logging, Log4J2, and Logback.
You can set different logging levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE) in the application.properties or application.yml file to control the amount of log output.
Example: logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG will set Spring Framework's web components to log at the DEBUG level.
3. Spring Boot Actuator:

Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features to help you monitor and manage your application.
Endpoints like /health, /info, /metrics, /loggers, etc., can provide a wealth of information about the application's state and environment.

# DTO, VO, Payload, DO, model
1. DTO (Data Transfer Object): transfer data between software application subsystems. They are often used to transfer data from the server side to the client side in a web application.
2. VO (Value Object): objects that represent some descriptive aspect of the domain with key attributes but no conceptual identity
3. Payload: In the context of web services (especially REST), the payload is the actual data (in XML, JSON, or another format) that is sent in the body of a request or response.
4. DO (Domain Object): part of the domain model and represent the business entities in a domain. They contain both data and behavior relevant to the domain.
5. Model: In MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, the Model represents the data and the business rules that govern access to and updates of this data.

# @JsonPropert
Jackson library, a popular Java-based library used for serializing Java objects to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and deserializing JSON to Java objects.
1. specify the name of a property in JSON. This is particularly useful when the name of the JSON field differs from the Java field name.
```java
public class User {
    @JsonProperty("user_name")
    private String userName;

    // getters and setters
}
```
2. mark a field or method to be included in serialization (Java object to JSON) and deserialization (JSON to Java object)
```java
public class User {
    private String userName;
    private String email;

    @JsonCreator
    public User(@JsonProperty("user_name") String userName, @JsonProperty("email") String email) {
        this.userName = userName;
        this.email = email;
    }
    // getters and setters
}
```

# spring boot starter
A Spring Boot Starter is essentially a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application. Each starter is designed to provide everything required to bootstrap a specific type of application or functionality.

# @RequestMapping
@RequestMapping annotation in Spring MVC is used for mapping web requests to specific handler methods
```java
@RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public ResponseEntity<?> createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
    // code to create a new user
}

@RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public ResponseEntity<List<User>> getAllUsers() {
    // code to retrieve all users
}

@RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.PUT)
public ResponseEntity<?> updateUser(@PathVariable("id") Long id, @RequestBody User user) {
    // code to update an existing user
}

@RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
public ResponseEntity<?> deleteUser(@PathVariable("id") Long id) {
    // code to delete a user
}
```

# ResponseEntity
ResponseEntity represents an entire HTTP response, including headers, body, and status code. 

# ResultSet
ResultSet is an object that represents the result set of a query executed against a database. It acts as a pointer to the rows returned by a query and provides methods to iterate and extract data

# ORM
An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework is a tool in software development that creates a "virtual object database" by mapping data from a relational database to objects in a programming language. 

# serialization and desrialization
converting data structures or object states into a format that can be stored and reconstructed later.

# Average
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32};

        double average = Arrays.stream(numbers).average().orElse(Double.NaN);

        System.out.println("Average: " + average);
    }
}
```

# Cassandra-Blog

```java
@Table
public class BlogPost {
    @PrimaryKey
    private UUID id;
    private String title;
    private String content;
    private String author;
    private LocalDateTime createdAt;

    // Getters and Setters
}

```

```java
public interface BlogPostRepository extends CassandraRepository<BlogPost, UUID> {
    // Define additional methods if necessary
}

```

```java
@Service
public class BlogPostService {
    private final BlogPostRepository repository;

    // Constructor with @Autowired
    // CRUD operations
}
```

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/blogposts")
public class BlogPostController {
    private final BlogPostService service;

    // Constructor with @Autowired

    // Create a blog post
    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<BlogPost> createPost(@RequestBody BlogPost post) {
        // Implementation
    }

    // Read a blog post by ID
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<BlogPost> getPostById(@PathVariable UUID id) {
        // Implementation
    }

    // Update a blog post
    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<BlogPost> updatePost(@PathVariable UUID id, @RequestBody BlogPost post) {
        // Implementation
    }

    // Delete a blog post
    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<Void> deletePost(@PathVariable UUID id) {
        // Implementation
    }

    // List all blog posts (consider pagination)
    @GetMapping
    public ResponseEntity<List<BlogPost>> getAllPosts() {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```
