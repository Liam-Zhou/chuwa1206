Q2
I've practiced the following command:

```
git commit
git branch
git checkout
git merge
git rebase
git clone
git push
git pull
git fetch
```

Q3
Basic steps involves:
```
git init
git add
git commit
```

Q4
```
git clone
```

Q5
```
git checkout -b branch_name
```

Q6
```
git checkout master
git merge branch_test
```

Q7
```
git checkout branch_learn_stash
git stash
```

Now switch to other branch and work on it, once ready to return to stashed work, use
```
git checkout branch_learn_stash
git stash pop
```

Using IntelliJ IDEA:
- Stash Your Changes on branch_learn_stash:
- Open the "Version Control" panel, usually found at the bottom of the IntelliJ window.
- Go to the "Local Changes" tab.
- Right-click on the changes you want to stash and select Stash Changes.
- Switch to another branch using the "Git Branches" popup in the bottom right corner of IntelliJ and perform your tasks.
- Switch back to the branch_learn_stash branch.
- Open the "Version Control" panel.
- Go to the "Stashes" tab.
- Right-click on the stash you want to apply and select "Pop Stash".

Q8
A Pull Request in Git is a mechanism for requesting that changes made in one branch (the PR's source branch) be pulled into another branch (the target/base branch).

Q9
Maven is a powerful build automation tool primarily used for Java projects.

Q10
Maven follows a predefined lifecycle to manage the building and deployment of projects. It has the following phase:
1. Validate: Checks if all the information necessary for the build is available.
2. Compile: Compiles the source code of the project.
3. Test: Tests the compiled source code using a suitable testing framework.
4. Package: Packages the compiled code in its distributable format.
5. Verify: Runs any checks to validate the package is valid and meets quality criteria.
6. Install: Installs the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally.
7. Deploy: Copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

Q11
The package phase in Maven is responsible for taking the compiled code and packaging it into its distributable format, such as a JAR, WAR, or EAR file. The install phase in Maven goes a step further than the package phase. After packaging the code, the install phase installs the package into the local Maven repository.

Q12
Plugins are the primary way of adding functionality to the build process.

Q13
Code are in the MavenProject directionary

Q14
Code review
