## Headings
To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.
```
# First-level heading
## Second-level heading
### Third-level heading
#### Fourth-level heading
##### Fifth-level heading
###### Sixth-level heading
```

## Styling text
You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, strikethrough, subscript, or superscript text in comment fields and .md files.

Bold `** ** or __ __` eg: `**This is bold text**` -> **This is bold text**

Strikethrough `~~ ~~` eg: `~~This was mistaken text~~` -> ~~This was mistaken text~~

Superscript `<sup> </sup>` eg: `This is a <sup>superscript</sup> text` -> This is a <sup>superscript</sup> text

## Quoting text
You can quote text with a >.

`> Quote a text` 
> Quote a text


## Quoting code

Use ` `` ` for within a sentence, and  ` ``` ``` ` for distinct block.

## Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ).

eg: Check [README](https://github.com/Liam-Zhou/chuwa1206/blob/main/README.md) file

or

eg: Check [hw1](\hw1.md) file

## Images
You can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in [ ]. Alt text is a short text equivalent of the information in the image. Then, wrap the link for the image in parentheses ().
