1. **What is authentication?** Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It involves confirming that an individual or entity is who they claim to be, typically through credentials such as usernames, passwords, biometric data, or other unique identifiers.
2. **What is authorization?** Authorization is the process of determining whether an authenticated user or system has the rights or permissions to perform certain actions or access specific resources within an application or system. It defines what an authenticated entity is allowed to do.
3. **What is the difference between authentication and authorization?**
   - **Authentication** is about verifying identity to ensure that users are who they claim to be.
   - **Authorization** occurs after authentication and determines the access levels or permissions that the authenticated user or entity has, dictating what they can and cannot do within a system or application.
4. **What is HTTP Session?** An HTTP Session is a server-side mechanism to maintain state and data across multiple HTTP requests from the same client. It is used to store user-specific information, such as user preferences or authentication status, persisting across several requests in a web application.
5. **What is a Cookie?** A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser while the user is browsing. Cookies are used to remember information about the user, such as login information, preferences, and other session data.
6. **What is the difference between Session and Cookie?**
   - **Session** is stored on the server side and maintains data across multiple requests from the same client. It is considered more secure as the information is not exposed to the client.
   - **Cookie** is stored on the client side, in the user's browser. It can maintain user data across different sessions but is less secure and has size limitations.
7. **How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the application?**
   - **Using Session:** Store user data on the server and associate it with a unique session identifier (session ID). The session ID is usually stored in a cookie on the client side, which is sent with each request, allowing the server to retrieve user-specific data stored in the session.
   - **Using Cookie:** Store user-specific data directly in cookies on the client side. These cookies are sent to the server with each HTTP request, allowing the server to read the stored information and make decisions based on it.
8. **What is JWT?** JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is used in authentication and authorization processes to securely transfer information between a client and a server as a JSON object, and it can be signed using a secret or a public/private key pair.
9. **What is the Spring Security filter?** Spring Security filter is a part of the Spring Security framework that intercepts incoming requests to an application to enforce security measures. It handles authentication, authorization, and other security concerns in the filter chain before allowing access to application resources.
10. **Describe how do JWTs work (referencing a diagram typically found on slide 26 of presentations).** JWT typically works in three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature.
    - The **Header** contains metadata about the type of token and the algorithm used for signing.
    - The **Payload** contains the claims, which are statements about an entity (typically the user) and additional data.
    - The **Signature** is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it claims to be and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way. In use, the server generates a JWT after authenticating a user and sends it to the client, which stores it and includes it in the HTTP header for subsequent requests. The server then verifies the JWT to authorize user requests.
11. **Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?** Yes, in secure applications, passwords are encoded using an encoder before being stored in a database. Spring Security provides several password encoders, like BCryptPasswordEncoder, which is widely used due to its cryptographic strength.
12. **What is UserDetailsService? AuthenticationProvider? AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?**
    - **UserDetailsService:** An interface used in Spring Security to retrieve user-related data. It loads a user by username and can be customized to load user information from various sources like databases.
    - **AuthenticationProvider:** An interface that defines how authentication is performed. It is used to authenticate a given `Authentication` object, returning a fully populated `Authentication` object if successful.
    - **AuthenticationManager:** An interface that manages the authentication process. It accepts an `Authentication` instance, processes it, and returns a fully authenticated object if successful.
    - **AuthenticationFilter:** Filters in the Spring Security filter chain that intercept authentication requests. Examples include `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter` and `JwtAuthenticationFilter`.
13. **What is the disadvantage of Session? How to overcome the disadvantage?** Sessions can be resource-intensive on the server side as the number of users increases, and they can complicate load balancing in distributed applications. To overcome these disadvantages, you can use token-based authentication mechanisms like JWT, which are stateless and scale more efficiently.
14. **How to get a value from application.properties?** In Spring, you can use the `@Value` annotation to inject property values from `application.properties` or `application.yml` into Spring beans, or you can use the `Environment` abstraction to programmatically access properties.
15. **What is the role of `configure(HttpSecurity http)` and `configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)`?**
    - `configure(HttpSecurity http)`: Defines which URL paths should be secured and how. It allows configuring web-based security for specific http requests. By default, it applies to all requests, but it can be restricted using antMatchers or similar methods.
    - `configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)`: Used for setting up an in-memory, JDBC, or LDAP authentication or for adding a custom `UserDetailsService`.
16. **What is Spring Security authentication and authorization?** Spring Security provides comprehensive security services for Java EE-based enterprise software applications. **Authentication** in Spring Security is the process of establishing a principal is who they claim to be (login). **Authorization** refers to the process of deciding whether a principal can access a particular resource within the application.
