2. Authentication is used to verify user's identity. It involves validating credentials like username and password against a security realm. 
3. Authorization determines if a user is allowed to access a resource. It's about granting or denying permissions based on their authenticated identity. 
4. Authentication verifies who a user is. Authorization determines what a user can do. 
5. A HTTP Session is a way to store user data across multiple HTTP requests. It's used to recognize users across different requests in stateless HTTP. 
6. A Cookie is a small piece data stored on the user's browser by a website. It's used to remember information about the user of future visits or within a session. 
7. Sessions store data on the server, identified by a session ID stored in the user's cookie. Cookie store data directly in the user's browser.
Sessions are more secure, while cookie have size limits and can persist across browser sessions. 
8. (1) When a user log in, create a session on the server. 

(2) Store a session ID in a cookie on the user's browser. 

(3) For subsequent requests, the browser sends the cookie with the session ID. 

(4) The server recognizes the session ID, retrieves user information from the session. 

(5) User state is maintained across the application. 
9. JWT(JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between  two parties. It's used in
authentication and information exchange, ensuring data integrity and security. 
10. Spring Security filter is a part of the Spring Security framework. It intercepts HTTP requests to enforce security. like authentication and authorization in a Spring Boot application. 
11. (1) User Authentication: User logs in with credentials. Server validates credentials.
    (2) Token Generation: Server creates a JWT, embedding user information and signing it.
    (3) Token Sending: JWT is sent back to the user.
    (4) Token Storage: User stores JWT, often in the browser's local storage or a cookie.
    (5) Token Use: For subsequent requests, JWT is included, typically in the HTTP header.
    (6) Server Verification: Server verifies JWT signature to ensure authenticity, extracts user data.
    (7) Access Control: Based on the verified JWT, server allows access to protected resources. 
12. Commonly Spring Security uses `BCryptPasswordEncoder`. They can provide hashing and salting to securely store passwords. 
13. (1) UserDetailsService: Interface in Spring Security for loading user-specific data. It's used to receive the user's authentication and authorization information.
    (2) AuthenticationProvider: Defines an authentication mechanism. It authenticates user credentials and creates an Authentication object.
    (3) AuthenticationManager: Interface managing the authentication process. It coordinates various AuthenticationProvides.
    (4) AuthenticationFilter: Filters incoming requests and attempts to authenticate them. 
14. `Advantage:` (1) Scalability: Sessions stored on a single server  limit scalability. Handling high traffic becomes challenging.
    (2) Memory Usage: Sessions consume server memory, affecting performance. (3) Load Balancing Issues: In a distributed environment, ensuring a user's requests hit the same server can be complex.
    (3) Load Balancing Issues: In a distributed environment, ensuring a user's requests hit the same server can be complex. 
`Disadvantages:` (1) Stateless Authentication: Use tokens like JWT for authentication, reducing server memory load.
    (2) Distributed Cache: Store sessions in a distributed cache, improving scalability and handling load balancing efficiently.
    (3) Session Replication: Replicate sessions across servers in a cluster to handle failover and load balancing. 
15. Use `@value` annotation. For example:
```
@Value("${property.name}")
private String propertyName;
```
Also can use `Environment` object. Example: 
```
environment.getProperty("property.name");
```
16. (1) configure(HttpSecurity http): Defines how to secure HTTP requests. You specify security constrains on endpoints, configure custom login and logout behavior, set up exception handling, and define session management policies.
    (2) configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth): Configures user authentication. It's where you define how the system finds user details and the password encoding mechanisms. 
17. Authentication: Verifies a user's identity. It involves validating credentials like username and password. Spring Security manages this through components. 

Authorization: Determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do.
