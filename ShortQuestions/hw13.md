# HW13 Testing

##  what is selenium?

User behavior simulation. You can write scripts to open a web browser, navigate to a website, interact with web elements, and perform various actions like click.



## what is cucumber?

A tool for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) . It uses Gherkin language, specifying test scenario with Given , when and then, like natural language. it's friendly to non technical people.



## what is JMeter

For load testing



## What is the lifecircle of Junit?

For each test, the lifecycle is setup - execute - clean up. And there're also before and after test behaviors.

## Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?

Because each test is run in parallel in different test class instance. Static beforeall and afterall allows it functioning on the whole test class.



## What is Mockito? and what is its limitations? what kind of tools can give help?

It helps in unit test by isolating tested code by replacing real dependencies with mock object.

limitation: static, final, private -> powerMockito



## What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?

@Mock defines an object that is going to mock. Any object that depends on this mock object should be marked as @InjectMocks, and the mock object will be inject into it and replace the real dependency.



## What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?

When you stub a method or function, you are specifying what it should return or how it should behave when it is called during a unit test. 



## what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers

ArgumentMatchers allows flexibie expression for the method argument when stubbing. e.g. as long as the argument match certain type, or value, or notnull.



## what is Hamcrest Matchers

It provides a set of matchers that allow you to express assertions in a more natural and readable way,  e.g.

``` java
assertThat(actual, is(equalTo(42)));
assertThat(names, hasItems("Alice", "Bob"));
assertThat(person, hasProperty("name", is("John")));
assertThat("JUnit is a testing framework", containsString("testing framework"));
```



## do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?

Both @Spy and @Mock are used together with @InjectMocks. But the difference is @Mock will only use the defined behaviors, while @Spy will call the real method if this method's mock behaviour is not defined.



## What is assertion?

is a statement or expression that checks if a particular condition or expectation holds true within a program or piece of code.



## If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature?and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of
tests?
There're unit test, integration test, regression test, performance test, stress test, user acceptance test.

Unit test and integration test are written by me.



- unit test: if each unit works well
- integration test: if units works well together
- regression: pass the past test
- performacne test: if the system works well in normal condition
- stress test: if system works well in heavy load
- user acceptance test: if the feature is welcome by users
