2. What is the authentication?
    
   - Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity to ensure that they are who they claim to be.
   In the context of computer systems and online services, authentication is a fundamental security mechanism that prevents unauthorized access
   and protects sensitive information.


3. What is the authorization?
    
    - Authorization is the process of determining what actions or operations a user, system, or entity is allowed to perform within a given system or resource.
      It involves granting or denying access permissions based on the authenticated identity and the defined set of rules or policies.

4. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

   Authentication:
   - In authentication process, the identity
     of users are checked for providing the
     access to the system.
   - In authentication process, users or
     persons are verified.
   - It is done before the authorization
     process.
   - It needs usually user’s login details
   - Authentication determines whether
     the person is user or not.
   - Generally, transmit information
     through an ID Token.

    Authorization: 
    - In authorization process, person’s
      or user’s authorities are checked for
      accessing the resources.
    - In this process, users or persons
      are validated.
    - This process is done after the
      authentication process.
    - It needs user’s privilege or security
      levels
    - it determines What permission
      do user have
    - Generally, transmit information through
      an Access Token.

5. What is HTTP Session?

    - An HTTP session is a mechanism that allows a web server to store and retrieve state information about the interaction with a specific client across multiple requests.

6. What is Cookie?

    - A cookie is a small piece of data stored on a user's computer by a web browser while the user is 
     browsing a website. Cookies are commonly used to store information that can be retrieved 
     and used by the server to recognize and track the user's interactions with the website. 
     Cookies serve various purposes, including session management, personalization, and 
    tracking user behavior.

7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?

    1. Session: Stored on the server. The server generates a unique session identifier, and the data associated with the session is stored on the server.
       Cookie: Stored on the user's device (client-side) as a text file.
   2. Session: A session is a way to store information (server-side) to persist data across multiple requests from the same user during a specific time period. It is typically managed by a server.
      Cookie: A cookie is a small piece of data (client-side) stored by the user's browser. It is sent with each HTTP request to the same domain that set the cookie.
   3. Session: Typically lasts for the duration of a user's interaction with a website, from login to logout or until the session expires due to inactivity.
      Cookie: Can have a specified expiration date or be set to expire when the user closes the browser (session cookies).
   4. Session: Applies to all pages on a website within the same session. Cookie: Can be domain-specific or limited to a specific path or subdomain.
   5. Session: Used to store and retrieve user-specific data, such as authentication information, preferences, and other session-specific details.
      Cookie: Used for various purposes, including session management, personalization, and tracking user behavior.
   6. Session: Typically considered more secure because session data is stored on the server. Cookie: Vulnerable to client-side attacks.

8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the
   application?

    - User Authentication: When a user logs into your application, you typically perform user authentication.
      Upon successful authentication, you generate a unique session identifier (usually a session token) on the server.
      Store user-specific information (e.g., user ID, username) in the server-side session storage associated with the session identifier.
    - Session Management: Use the session identifier to associate subsequent requests from the same user with the correct session on the server.
    - Setting Cookies: When a user logs in or performs some action that requires persistence, you can set a cookie in the HTTP response.
      Include the session identifier (or any other relevant data) in the cookie.
      Set attributes like the cookie's domain, path, expiration date, and secure/HttpOnly flags based on your requirements.
    - Sending Cookies with Requests: The user's browser automatically includes cookies in subsequent HTTP requests to the same domain.
      The server can extract the session identifier or other information from the cookies to identify the user and retrieve the associated session data.

9. What is JWT?

    - JSON Web Token is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. 
      JWT is often used for authentication and authorization in web development. It is a self-contained token that consists of a header, a payload, and a signature. The structure looks like header.payload.signature.
    - Header: The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token (JWT) and the signing algorithm being used.
    - Payload: The payload contains statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.
    - Signature: To create the signature part, you take the encoded header, encoded payload, a secret (for HMAC algorithms), and sign that.

10. What is the spring security filter?

    - Spring Security is a powerful and customizable authentication and access control framework for Java applications. 
      The Spring Security framework includes a set of filters that are integral to its functioning. 
      These filters are part of the Spring Security filter chain, which processes requests and responses to enforce security measures.

11. decribe how do JWT work(slides ⾥有图， 26页)

    1. A user sends request of authentication or authorization to the server.
    2. Server validates the information of user and generates te JWT using secret key.
    3. Server sends response to the client with the JWT.
    4. Later when the user sends other requests, JWT is automatically sent in the header.
    5. Server validates JWT using the secret key.
    6. Server returns the response to the client if authentication or authorization satisfied.

12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?

    - one common approach is to use the BCrypt password hashing algorithm. 
      Spring Security, a popular security framework in the Spring ecosystem, 
     provides support for password encoding using BCrypt. `PasswordEncoder` is provided by `spring-boot-starter-security`.

13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager?
    AuthenticationFilter?(把这⼏个名字看熟悉也⾏)

    - These are key components that play roles in the authentication process:
    - UserDetailsService is an interface provided by Spring Security to retrieve user-related data.
    - AuthenticationProvider is responsible for authenticating a user based on the provided Authentication object.
    - AuthenticationManager is the central component responsible for authenticating users. It delegates the authentication process to one or more AuthenticationProvider instances.
    - AuthenticationFilter  is part of the Spring Security filter chain and handles the actual process of extracting credentials from incoming requests and creating an Authentication object.
    


14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?

    - Scalability Issues: When the application is distributed across multiple servers (horizontal scaling), managing sessions becomes complex.
      Load balancing may result in requests going to different servers, and session data needs to be shared or replicated.
    - Resource Consumption: Each user session consumes server resources, and if not managed properly, it can lead to resource exhaustion.
    - Ways to Overcome Session Disadvantages:
        1. Token-Based Authentication (JWT): Instead of using server-side sessions, consider using token-based authentication like JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Tokens are stateless and can be securely stored on the client side.
    

15. how to get value from application.properties?

    - Use @Value annotations, eg:
    ```@Value(${Secret_Key})```
    

16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and
    configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?

    - In Spring Security, both are methods provided by the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class. 
      They help configure security settings for web application.
    - configure(HttpSecurity http): This method is responsible for configuring security settings related to HTTP requests.
      It allows you to define which paths should be secured, what kind of authentication is required, and what authorization rules should be applied.
      You can specify how different types of requests (e.g., GET, POST) should be handled in terms of security.
    - configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth): This method is responsible for configuring the authentication manager.
      It allows you to define how user authentication should be performed. This includes specifying the user details service, password encoding, and other authentication-related settings.

17. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?

    - Authentication: In Spring Security: Spring Security provides various mechanisms for authenticating users. 
      It supports in-memory authentication, JDBC-based authentication, LDAP authentication, OAuth, and more.
      Key Concepts: UserDetailsService: An interface used to retrieve user details, such as username, password, and roles.
      AuthenticationManager: Responsible for authenticating users based on the provided credentials.
      Authentication: Represents the result of a successful authentication. It contains the user's principal (identity) and authorities (roles).
    - Authorization: Spring Security enables fine-grained access control through method-level and URL-based security. It allows you to define who can access which parts of your application.
      Key Concepts: GrantedAuthority: Represents a granted authority or role assigned to a user.
      GrantedAuthorityProvider: An interface for providing additional authorities to an authenticated user.
      SecurityExpressionHandler: Evaluates expressions for access control decisions.
    - In summary, Spring Security authentication ensures that users are who they claim to be, and authorization controls what actions or resources authenticated users are allowed to access.
