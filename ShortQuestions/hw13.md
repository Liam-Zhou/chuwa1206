####  what is selenium?
A tool for simulating user behavior

####  what is cucumber?
Cucumber is a tool used for behavior-driven development (BDD). It allows you to write test cases in a natural language format, and these test cases can be executed to verify the behavior of your application.

####  what is JMeter?
It is a tool for testing the performance of web applications by simulating headvy load on the server. Commonly used for stress testing.

####  What is the lifecircle of Junit?
class level set up: @BeforeAll
setup: @BeforeEach
execution: @Test
cleanup: @AfterEach
class level clean up: @AfterAll

####  Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
Yes, it should be a static method because it runs before any instance of the test class is created. 

#### What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?  what kind of tools can give help?
Mockito: Mockito is a mocking framework for Java. It allows the creation of mock objects to simulate the behavior of real objects in a controlled way.

Limitations: Mockito cannot mock final classes, static methods, and final methods. It may have difficulties mocking some complex classes with intricate inheritance hierarchies.

Tools: PowerMock is a tool that extends Mockito and allows the mocking of final classes, static methods, and final methods.

####  What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
@Mock is an annotation that create a mock object
@InjectMocks is used to inject mocked dependencies into the target object in Mockito.

####  What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?
Stubbing: In Mockito, stubbing refers to defining the behavior of a mock object. It involves specifying what a method should return when it is invoked with specific arguments.

####  what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers
Mockito provides ArgumentMatchers to define flexible argument matching when stubbing or verifying method calls.

####  what is Hamcrest Matchers
Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects. Matchers are used in testing frameworks to perform assertions and make tests more readable.

####  do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?
@Spy defines partcially mocked that allows real methods of the object to be called, unlike a full mock created with @Mock.

####  What is assertion?
It is statement in test that verifies an expected condition.

####  If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of tests?

Unit test: To test individual components or functions in isolation.
Integration test: To test how different components work together.
Regression test: After modifying the program or environment, re-run previously run tests to confirm that no new errors have been introduced
