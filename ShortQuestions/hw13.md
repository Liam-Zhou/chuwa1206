1. List all of the new learned annotations to your annotations.md
2. what is selenium?

   Selenium is a tool to support user-behavior simulation.

3. what is cucumber?

   Cucumber is a tool to support behavior-driven development.

4. what is JMeter?

   JMeter is a load testing tool

5. What is the lifecycle of Junit?

   @BeforeAll, @BeforeEach, @AfterEach, @AfterAll

6. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?

   Yes. @BeforeAll has to be static

7. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations? what kind of tools can give help?

   Mockito simplifies testing development by mocking the external dependencies. Mockito cannot mock static, final or private methods. PowerMockito gives the capabilities.

8. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?

   @Mock can create a mock instance and injects that instance into instance created by @InjectMocks.

9. What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?

   A stub is an object that holds predefined data and uses it to answer calls during the test.

10. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers

    ArgumentMatchers allow us flexible stubbing as long as we use the same type of argument as the argument matchers.

11. what is Hamcrest Matchers

    It uses existing predicates that are called matcher classes to make assertions.

12. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?

    For @Spy, if we don't define its corresponding behavior, it will call the true method. For @Mock, if we don't define its corresponding behavior, it will return an empty instance.

13. What is assertion?

    Assertions are used to define expected behavior of a test.

14. If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of tests?

    There are unit test, integration test, regression test, performance test, stress test, and user acceptance test.

    Unit test, integration test, and regression test should be written by me.

    Unit test is to ensure a unit (method) works properly, an integration test is to ensure the interactions of different parts work properly, regression test is to ensure that after each modification of code, previous functionalities are still correct, performance test is to check if the system has a good performance and efficiency, stress test is to ensure the system can work normally under pressure, and user acceptance test is to ensure the software meets users' needs.

15. Add unit test for CommentServiceImpl, the coverage should be 100%.
16. write Integration tests for PostController. The tests should cover all scenarios.
