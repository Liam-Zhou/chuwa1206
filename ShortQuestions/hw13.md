### 2. What is selenium?
**Question**: What is selenium?
Selenium is an open-source web automation tool used primarily for automating web applications for testing purposes. It supports multiple browsers, programming languages, and platforms.

### 3. What is cucumber?
**Question**: What is cucumber?
Cucumber is a tool used for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). It enables writing test cases in a natural language style, making the documentation both executable as a test and readable as a specification.

### 4. What is JMeter?
**Question**: What is JMeter?
JMeter is an open-source software designed for load testing and measuring performance. It's primarily used for web applications but also supports other test functions.

### 5. What is the lifecycle of Junit?
**Question**: What is the lifecycle of Junit?
The JUnit lifecycle includes annotated methods such as @BeforeClass, @Before, @Test, @After, and @AfterClass, which run in a specific order to set up, execute, and tear down tests.

### 6. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
**Question**: Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
Yes, the @BeforeAll method in JUnit should be static as it runs once before all the tests in the class, typically used for one-time setup.

### 7. What is Mockito? and what are its limitations? What kind of tools can give help?
**Question**: What is Mockito? and what are its limitations? What kind of tools can give help?
- Mockito is a Java-based mocking framework used in unit testing to isolate the unit of work by mocking dependencies. 
- Its limitations include the inability to mock static, final, or private methods directly, and it cannot mock constructors or create mocks for private classes. 
- Tools like PowerMock or JMockit complement Mockito by providing capabilities to overcome these limitations, such as mocking static and private methods or final classes.

### 8. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
**Question**: What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
@Mock is used to create and inject mocked instances. @InjectMocks is used to create instances of the class and injects mocks that are created with the @Mock annotations into it.

### 9. What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?
**Question**: What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?
Stubbing in Mockito refers to defining the behavior of mocks, specifying what should be returned when specific methods are called on the mock objects.

### 10. What is Mockito ArgumentMatchers?
**Question**: What is Mockito ArgumentMatchers?
Mockito ArgumentMatchers allow specifying flexible argument conditions when stubbing methods, enabling the method to respond differently based on the input.

### 11. What is Hamcrest Matchers?
**Question**: What is Hamcrest Matchers?
Hamcrest Matchers is a framework used for writing matchers, enabling more readable and flexible assertions in tests.

### 12. Do you know @spy? What is the difference between @spy and @Mock?
**Question**: Do you know @spy? What is the difference between @spy and @Mock?
@Spy is an annotation in Mockito that creates a spy of the real object. While @Mock creates a complete mock or dummy object, @Spy creates a proxy that calls the real methods of the object but still allows some methods to be stubbed. The key difference is that @Spy wraps a real object and tracks interactions with it, whereas @Mock creates a completely new object where all methods are stubbed and do not have any original method behavior.

### 13. What is assertion?
**Question**: What is assertion?
An assertion in testing is a statement that checks if a particular condition is true. It's used to verify that the application behaves as expected.

### 14. If you have developed a new feature, what types of tests are needed for this feature? What kind of tests are written by you? What is the purpose of each type of tests?
**Question**: If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? And what kind of tests are written by you? What is the purpose of each type of tests?
For a newly developed feature, several types of tests are crucial to ensure its quality and functionality:
- **Unit Tests**: Validate individual components or functions in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify interactions and data flow between modules.
- **Functional Tests**: Check the feature against specified requirements.
- **UI/End-to-End Tests**: Confirm user interface and interactions.
- **Performance Tests**: Measure responsiveness and scalability under load.
- **Security Tests**: Secure the feature against vulnerabilities.
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure new changes don't adversely affect existing functionality.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Validate the end-to-end business flow with the end-users.
- **Stress Tests**: Determine the limits and the stability of the system under extreme conditions.
Each test type targets specific aspects, from code-level validation in unit tests to assessing the overall system stability in stress tests.

### 15. Add unit test for CommentServiceImpl, the coverage should be 100%.

### 16. write Integration tests for PostController. The tests should cover all scenarios.
