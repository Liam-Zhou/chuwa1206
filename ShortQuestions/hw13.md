### 2. selenium
Selenium is a popular open-source testing tool used for web application testing. 
It enables testers to write automated tests in various programming languages to test the functionality of web applications
### 3. cucumber
Cucumber is an open-source software testing tool written in Ruby. 
Cucumber enables you to write test cases that anyone can easily understand regardless of their technical knowledge
### 4. JMeter
The Apache JMeter is an open-source, purely Java-based software. The software is used to perform performance testing, functional testing, and load testing of web applications. 
It is used to test load testing functional behavior and measuring performance
### 5. lifecycle of Junit
JUnit 5 test case needs to get through multiple life cycles. 
Primarily there is 4 major life cycle of Junit 5 ie @BeforeAll, @BeforeEach, @AfterEach and @AfterAll
### 6. @BeforeAll
@BeforeAll is used to signal that the annotated method should be executed before all tests in the current test class
### 7. Mockito, limitation, tools
Mockito is a Java-based framework used for unit testing of Java applications. This mocking framework helps in the development of testable applications.

Mockito cannot be used for the final and static methods.

We can use PowerMockito for this situation.
### 8. @Mock, @InjectMock
The @Mock Annotation is used to mock the objects that assist in minimizing the repeated mock objects. 
@Mock makes the test code and verification error convenient to read as the parameter names are used to identify the mocks

@InjectMocks annotations allow us to inject mocked dependencies in the annotated class mocked object. 
This is useful when we have external dependencies in the class we want to mock. We can specify the mock objects to be injected using @Mock or @Spy annotations
### 9. stubbing and behavior
Mockito allows you to define the behavior of mock objects, such as specifying what methods should be called, what values should be returned, 
and how many times certain methods should be invoked.
### 10. Mockito ArgumentMatchers
Mockito ArgumentMatchers are utility methods provided by Mockito to define flexible matching criteria for method arguments when stubbing or verifying interactions with mock objects. 
ArgumentMatchers help you set up behavior for methods that take specific arguments without specifying exact values.
### 11. Hamcrest Matchers
Hamcrest is a framework that assists writing software tests in the Java programming language. 
It supports creating customized assertion matchers ('Hamcrest' is an anagram of 'matchers'), allowing match rules to be defined declaratively. 
These matchers have uses in unit testing frameworks such as JUnit and jMock.
### 12. @spy, @spy vs @Mock
@Spy is used to call all the normal methods of an object while still tracking every possible interaction similar to a normal object.

Mock objects don't execute the real methods of the underlying object. They provide default behavior or behavior defined using Mockito stubbing methods. 
Spy executes the real methods of the underlying object by default.
### 13. assertion
An assertion is a statement in the Java programming language that enables you to test your assumptions about your program
### 14. type of tests for a new feature
unit tests for all the methods of the feature. Integration test for the updated project. Regression test combines both unit tests and integration tests.
