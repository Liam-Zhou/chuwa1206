## 3. How Do You Handle Exceptions in Spring?

- In Spring, exceptions can be handled using the `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` annotations.
- `@ControllerAdvice` allows you to handle exceptions across the whole application, not just to an individual controller. You can define a class with `@ControllerAdvice` and add methods with `@ExceptionHandler` to handle different exceptions.
- `@ExceptionHandler` is used to define methods for handling specific exceptions. These methods can return a response body, which allows for a more controlled and cleaner error response.
