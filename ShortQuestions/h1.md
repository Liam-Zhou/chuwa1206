## 10. What is the lifecycle of maven? could you tell me the details ?
Maven defines a build lifecycle to standardize and simplify the build process for projects. It includes
- validate: Validates the project state.
- compile: Compiles the source code.
- test: Runs tests against compiled code.
- package: Packages the compiled code into a distributable format.
- verify: Runs additional checks to verify the package.
- install: Installs the package into the local repository.
- deploy: Copies the package to a remote repository

## 11. What is the difference between package and install in maven lifecycle ?
- `Mvn package`: Creates JAR or WAR file for the project to convert it into a distributable format. 
- `Mvn install`: Deploys the packaged JAR/ WAR file to the local repository.

## 12. What is plugins in maven, list some plugins.
- `maven-compiler-plugin`: Compiles Java source code to bytecode. It allows you to specify the source and target Java versions.
- `maven-surefire-plugin`: Executes unit tests. It is commonly used to run JUnit tests during the build process
- `maven-jar-plugin`: Creates a JAR (Java Archive) file for your project.
- `maven-clean-plugin`: Deletes the target directory, cleaning up the artifacts generated during the build.
- `maven-dependency-plugin`: Manages dependencies, allowing you to copy or unpack them.

## 13. In Repo/MavenProject directory, create a maven Module using Intellij, named it as below
```
    <dependency>
    <groupId>com.chuwa.learn</groupId>
    <artifactId>java-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
