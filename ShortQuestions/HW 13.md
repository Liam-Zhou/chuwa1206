## **1. What is Selenium?**

Selenium is an open-source automation testing framework for web applications. It supports multiple browsers and programming languages, enabling testers to write test scripts in languages such as Java, C#, Python, etc. Selenium can be used to automate browser actions, such as navigating to a webpage, clicking on buttons, entering text into forms, and validating text or UI elements on webpages.

## **2. What is Cucumber?**

Cucumber is a tool used for testing software. It runs automated acceptance tests written in a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) style. At its core, Cucumber reads executable specifications written in plain language and validates that the software does what those specifications say. It allows the involvement of non-technical stakeholders in the testing process, ensuring that the software meets business requirements.

## **3. What is JMeter?**

JMeter is an open-source load testing tool developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is primarily used for analyzing and measuring the performance of web applications. JMeter can simulate multiple users with concurrent requests to test the strength and analyze the overall performance of a variety of services, focusing on web applications.

## **4. What is the lifecycle of JUnit?**

The lifecycle of JUnit includes annotations like **`@BeforeAll`**, **`@BeforeEach`**, **`@Test`**, **`@AfterEach`**, and **`@AfterAll`** to define setup, teardown, and test conditions. This lifecycle allows for precise control over how tests are set up, executed, and torn down, ensuring tests run in an isolated and predictable manner.

## **5. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level (static)?**

Yes, the **`@BeforeAll`** annotation in JUnit 5 should be used on a static method to indicate that this method should be executed before all tests in the test class. It's used for setting up shared resources that are needed for all tests within the class.

## **6. What is Mockito? and what are its limitations? What kind of tools can give help?**

Mockito is a mocking framework for unit tests in Java. It allows developers to create and configure mock objects for testing purposes, facilitating the isolation of test units. However, Mockito has limitations such as the inability to mock static methods, constructors, and private methods directly. Tools like PowerMock can help overcome some of these limitations by extending the capabilities of mocking frameworks.

## **7. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?**

**`@Mock`** is an annotation used in Mockito to create a mock instance of a class or interface. **`@InjectMocks`** is used to create an instance of a class and injects mocks marked with **`@Mock`** into it. This is useful for injecting mock dependencies into the class under test.

## **8. What is stubbing (define behaviors)?**

Stubbing is a technique used in unit testing to define the behavior of mocks or stubs. It allows developers to specify the output or response of a mock object when certain methods are called. This is crucial for isolating the unit of work being tested and ensuring that the test does not inadvertently depend on the behavior or state of external systems or classes.

## **9. What is Mockito ArgumentMatchers?**

Mockito ArgumentMatchers are special methods in Mockito that allow for flexible verification or stubbing of methods with parameters. They can match arguments passed to mock methods based on types, values, or custom conditions, making tests more robust and flexible.

## **10. What is Hamcrest Matchers?**

Hamcrest Matchers is a framework for writing matcher objects, allowing for more expressive and readable assertions in tests. It is often used in conjunction with testing frameworks like JUnit to provide a rich set of matchers for asserting conditions in tests, such as equality, collection contents, or string patterns.

## **11. Do you know @spy? What is the difference between @spy and @Mock?**

**`@Spy`** is an annotation used in Mockito to create a spy instance of a class. Spies are used to partially mock objects; while real methods are invoked by default, specific methods can be stubbed. The difference between **`@spy`** and **`@Mock`** is that **`@Mock`** creates a complete mock where none of the real methods are invoked, whereas **`@spy`** can use the real methods of the object unless those methods are explicitly stubbed.

## **12. What is assertion?**

An assertion is a statement in test code that checks if a specified condition is true. It's a key component of testing frameworks, allowing developers to validate the state of the application or the outcome of a test case. If an assertion fails, it indicates a bug in the application or an error in the test logic.

## **13. If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? And what kind of tests are written by you? What is the purpose of each type of tests?**

For a new feature, various types of tests can be written, including:

- Unit tests to validate individual components or functions.
- Integration tests to ensure different parts of the application work together as expected.
- System tests to verify the complete and integrated software product.
- Acceptance tests to confirm the software meets business requirements. The purpose of each type of test varies, from validating low-level details with unit tests to ensuring the overall system meets user needs with acceptance tests.
