### hw42 Exception & Validation

1. [annotation.md](./annotation.md)

2. **@Configuration**: A Spring annotation used on classes to indicate that they contain bean definitions and configuration information for the Spring container.

   **@Bean**: An annotation used on methods within a @Configuration-annotated class to define a bean that will be managed by the Spring container.

3. Using the `@ControllerAdvice` annotation for global exception handling and `@ExceptionHandler` to define methods for handling specific exceptions within a controller or globally. Additionally, `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler` can be extended for more comprehensive global error handling.

4. Using the `@Valid` annotation in combination with Java's Bean Validation API. 

   Common annotations:

   - `@NotNull`: Field must not be null.
   - `@NotEmpty`: Field must not be null or empty.
   - `@NotBlank`: Field must not be null and must contain at least one non-whitespace character.
   - `@Size(min=, max=)`: Field must be within a specified size range.
   - `@Min(value)`: Numeric field must be no less than the specified value.
   - `@Max(value)`: Numeric field must be no greater than the specified value.
   - `@Email`: Field must be a valid email address.
   - `@Pattern(regexp)`: Field must match the specified regular expression.

5. The Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features to monitor and manage Spring Boot applications. 

   Common annotations:

   - `health`: Shows application health information.
   - `info`: Displays arbitrary application info.
   - `metrics`: Shows various metrics for the application.
   - `env`: Exposes properties from Springâ€™s ConfigurableEnvironment.
   - `loggers`: Shows and modifies the configuration of loggers in the application.
   - `threaddump`: Performs a thread dump.
   - `auditevents`: Exposes audit events (if any) for the application.

### hw43 Spring Basic

1. [annotation.md](./annotation.md)

2. **Spring**: A powerful, widely-used Java framework for building enterprise applications, offering features like Dependency Injection and aspect-oriented programming, facilitating the development of loosely coupled, testable components.

   **Spring Boot**: A project built on top of the Spring framework, designed to simplify the bootstrapping and development of new Spring applications. Key features include auto-configuration, standalone code, and an embedded server.

   Benefit: decouple

3. **IOC (Inversion of Control)**: A design principle where the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework, rather than the program itself being in charge of that control.

   **DI (Dependency Injection)**: A pattern used to implement IOC, where objects are given their dependencies (services, resources, etc.) by an external entity (like a framework), rather than creating them internally. This enhances modularity and facilitates testing.

4. **@ComponentScan**: A Spring annotation used to specify the packages to scan for Spring components. It enables automatic detection of Spring components like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller` within specified packages.

5. In XML: Use the `<context:component-scan>` element with the `base-package` attribute to specify the package, like `<context:component-scan base-package="com.example.package" />`.

   With Annotation: Use `@ComponentScan` and specify the package in its value attribute, like `@ComponentScan("com.example.package")`.

6. @Configuration + @EnableAutoConfiguration + @ComponentScan

7. 3 ways:

   **Annotation-based Configuration**: Using annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller` on classes. Additionally, `@Bean` can be used on methods within `@Configuration`-annotated classes.

   **Java-based Configuration**: Defining beans in a Java class marked with `@Configuration`. Beans are methods annotated with `@Bean` in this class.

   **XML-based Configuration**: Declaring beans in an XML file using the `<bean>` element. This is the traditional way of defining beans, especially in older Spring applications.

8. @Component: The class name with the first letter in lowercase. @Bean: The method name

9. **@Component**: A generic stereotype annotation indicating that a class is a Spring component. It's a general-purpose annotation for any Spring-managed component.

   **@Service** and **@Repository**: Specialized stereotypes of `@Component`. `@Service` indicates a service layer component, and `@Repository` indicates a data access layer component. 

10. **@Autowired**: Spring's own annotation for automatic dependency injection.

    **@Inject**: Part of the Java CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) standard (`javax.inject.Inject`).

    **@Resource**: Part of the Java standard (`javax.annotation.Resource`), allows specifying a bean by its name.

11. 3 types:

    1. **Constructor Injection**: Injecting dependencies through the class constructor.
    2. **Setter Injection**: Injecting dependencies using setter methods.
    3. **Field Injection**: Injecting dependencies directly into fields using annotations like `@Autowired`.

    Constructor Injection is generally considered better because:

    - It enforces immutability, making objects less prone to errors.
    - Dependencies are explicitly required, ensuring that the object is always in a fully initialized state.
    - It's more conducive to unit testing as dependencies can be easily passed in tests without requiring reflection.

12. @Primary. If no primary bean is set, `@Qualifier` annotation along with `@Autowired`, where you provide the specific bean name to be injected.

13. **BeanFactory**: The basic container that manages beans in Spring, providing fundamental functionalities for bean instantiation and wiring.

    **ApplicationContext**: Extends `BeanFactory`, offering more advanced features such as event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create beans, and internationalization support. It represents a more complete solution for managing a Spring application's configuration and lifecycle.

14. **Singleton**: (Default) Only one instance of the bean is created for the entire application context. Example: A configuration bean.

    **Prototype**: A new instance is created each time the bean is requested. Example: Data transfer objects.

15. ```xml
    <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
           xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                               http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">
    
        <!-- Bean with dependencies -->
        <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyClass">
            <property name="dependency" ref="dependencyBean"/>
        </bean>
    
        <!-- Dependencies -->
        <bean id="dependencyBean" class="com.example.Dependency"/>
    
    </beans>
    ```
