##### 1. Write up Example code to demonstrate the three foundmental concepts of OOP.

```java
//Encapsulation
class Person{
  private String name;
  private String email;
  
  public Person(String name, String email){
    this.name=name;
    this.email=email;
  }
  
  //...
  public void setEmail(String email){
    this.email=email;
  }
  
  public String getEmail(){
    return this.email;
  }
}
```

```java
//Polymorphism
class Test{
  //compile time
  public int poly1(int a, int b){
    return a+b;
  }
  
  public int poly2(int a){
    return a;
  }
  
  public void solve(){
    //runtime
    List<Integer> list1=new ArrayList<Integer>();
    List<Integer> list2=new LinkedList<Integer>();
  }
}
```

```java
//Inheritance
class Student extends Person{
  private int studentId;
  
  public Student(String name,String email,int studentId){
    super(name,email);
    this.studentId=studentId;
  }
  
  //...
}
```



##### 2. What is wrapper class in Java and Why we need wrapper class?

They are object form of primitive types.

Sometimes we must use wrapper classes, for example when working with Collection objects.

##### 3. What is the difference between HashMap and HashTable?

HashTable is synchronized and thread-safe. HashMap is not thread-safe.

HashTable doesn't allow null keys; A HashMap does.

##### 4. What is String pool in Java and why we need String pool?

String pool is a cache mechanism for string literals.

With String pool we can reuse the String objects to reduce duplicates and save memory.

##### 5. What is Java garbage collection?

In Java, memory release is handled automatically by garbage collection. GC will release the objects in the heap that cannot be referenced.

##### 6. What are access modifiers and their scopes in Java?

| Modifier  | Scopes                                 |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| default   | visible within package                 |
| private   | visible within the class               |
| protected | visible within package and sub-classes |
| public    | visible every where                    |



##### 7. What is final key word? (Field, Method, Class)

- field
  - primitive values cannot be changed
  - objects cannot be re-reference
- method
  - cannot be overridden
- class
  - cannot be inherited

##### 8. What is static keyword? (Field, Method, Class). When do we usually use it?

- field
  - only one instance in jvm. Can be accessed by class name
- method
  - can be called by class name
- class
  - static keyword can only be applied to nested classes
  - A static nested class may be instantiated without instantiating its outer class.
  -  A static class can access only the static members of the outer class.
- blocks
  - executed when the class is loaded

##### 9. What is the differences between overriding and overloading?

| Overloading | Overriding |
| ---- | ---- |
| Overloading happens at compile time. | Overriding happens at runtime |
| Gives better performance because the binding is being done at compile time. | Gives less performance because the binding is being done at run time. |
| Private and final methods can be overloaded. | Private and final methods can NOT be overridden. |
| Return type of method does not matter in case of method overloading | Return type of method must be the same in the case of overriding. |
| Arguments must be different in the case of overloading. | Arguments must be the same in the case of overriding |
| lt is being done in the same class. | Base and derived(child) classes are required here. |
| Mostly used to increase the readability of the code. | Mostly used to provide the implementation of the method that is already provided by its base class. |



##### 10. What is the differences between super and this?

super refers to the parent class; this refers to the current class

##### 11. What is the Java load sequence?

static fields -> static blocks -> constructor

##### 12. What is Polymorphism ? And how Java implements it ?

Polymorphism is the process in which an object or function takes different forms. There are 2 types of Polymorphism : 

- Compile Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading) 
- Run Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

##### 13. What is Encapsulation ? How Java implements it? And why we need encapsulation?

Encapsulation refers to binding the data and the methods to manipulate that data together in a single unit (class).

It's implemented by access modifiers.

Because we want to hide data or methods we don't want outside to know, and show only those safe to show.

##### 14. What is Interface and what is abstract class? What are the differences between them?

Interface

An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.

Abstract Class

A class that is declared using “abstract” keyword is known as abstract class. It can have abstract methods (methods without body) as well as concrete methods (methods with body).

Difference

- Abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods but interface can only have abstract methods (Java 8 onwards, it can have default and static methods as well) 
- Abstract class methods can have access modifiers other than public but interface methods are implicitly public and abstract 
- Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables but interface variables are only static and final 
- A subclass can extend only one abstract class but it can implement multiple interfaces 
- An Abstract class can extend one other class and can implement multiple interfaces but an interface can only extend other interfaces

##### 16. What are Queue interface implementations and what are the differences and when to use what?

| Implementations                | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Deque (LinkedList, ArrayDeque) | Provides FIFO queue operations and stack operations.         |
| PriorityQueue                  | Based on heap. Used when order is needed.                    |
| Concurrent Queues              | They are thread-safe. Used under multi-thread circumstances. |
