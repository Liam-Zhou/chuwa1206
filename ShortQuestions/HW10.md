1. **What is Spring and Springboot? What are the benefits of using Spring Boot?**

   **Spring** is a powerful, lightweight framework for building Java applications. It provides a comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java apps, offering features such as Inversion of Control (IoC), Dependency Injection (DI), aspect-oriented programming, transaction management, and more.

   **Spring Boot** is a project built on top of the Spring framework. It simplifies the bootstrapping and development of new Spring applications through convention over configuration. It provides a range of out-of-the-box functionalities to create stand-alone, production-grade applications easily.

   **Benefits of using Spring Boot:**

   - Simplified configuration: Auto-configuration and starter dependencies reduce the need for manual configurations.
   - Stand-alone: Spring Boot applications can be run independently without deploying on a web server.
   - Opinionated defaults: Offers sensible defaults for quick setup and configuration.
   - Embedded server: Easy to start with embedded Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow servers.
   - Actuator: Provides built-in endpoints for monitoring and managing the application.

2. What is IOC and What is DI? 

   **IoC (Inversion of Control):** It's a principle in software engineering where the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework. In the context of Spring, IoC refers to the Spring Framework's IoC container, which manages the instantiation, configuration, and assembly of beans.

   **DI (Dependency Injection):** It's a design pattern that implements IoC, where an object's dependencies are injected by another object. In Spring, dependencies are injected by the IoC container via constructors, setters, or properties, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.

3. What is @CompnonentScan? 

   **@ComponentScan** is an annotation in Spring that is used to specify the packages that the Spring framework will scan for components, configurations, and services. It automatically detects and registers beans from pre-defined project packages, reducing manual bean registration in configuration files.

4. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton? 

   - **XML:** In XML configuration, you can define the packages to scan using the `<context:component-scan base-package="package.name"/>` tag, where `package.name` is the name of the package you want Spring to scan.
   - **Annotation:** Using the `@ComponentScan(basePackages = "package.name")` annotation in a configuration class, where `package.name` is the target package.

5. What is @SpringbootApplication? 

   **@SpringBootApplication** is a convenience annotation in Spring Boot that encapsulates `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan` annotations. It's used on the main class and signals Spring Boot to start auto-configuration, component scanning, and to enable Spring configuration.

6. How many ways wo can define a bean? 

   Beans can be defined in several ways in Spring:

   - Annotation-based configuration using `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, etc.
   - Java-based configuration using `@Bean` annotation inside a `@Configuration` class.
   - XML-based configuration by declaring beans in an XML file.

7. What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean? 

   The default bean name for a class annotated with `@Component` (and its specializations like `@Service`, `@Repository`) is the uncapitalized non-qualified class name. For methods annotated with `@Bean`, the default bean name is the method name.

8. What is the difference between @component and @service,@repository? 

   `@Component` is a generic stereotype annotation indicating a Spring-managed component. `@Service` and `@Repository` are specializations of `@Component` for service-layer and data access layer components, respectively. They provide additional semantics: `@Repository` can translate database-related exceptions, and `@Service` indicates service-layer operations.

9. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean? 

   Several annotations can be used for injection in Spring, including:

   - `@Autowired` (for constructor, field, and setter injection)
   - `@Inject` (standard Java annotation for DI)
   - `@Resource` (for injecting by name)

10. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why? 

    The three main types of dependency injection in Spring are:

    - **Constructor Injection:** Dependencies are provided through a class constructor.
    - **Setter Injection:** Dependencies are injected through setter methods.
    - **Field Injection:** Dependencies are injected directly into the class fields.

    **Constructor Injection** is generally considered better, especially for mandatory dependencies, as it ensures that the object is created with all its dependencies, promoting immutability and easier testing.

11. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.

    To designate a bean as primary when multiple beans of the same type exist, use the `@Primary` annotation on the bean definition. If no primary bean is specified, you can use `@Qualifier` annotation to specify which bean to inject by its name.

12. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring? 

    **BeanFactory** is the basic container that manages beans. **ApplicationContext** extends BeanFactory and provides more enterprise-specific functionalities like event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create beans, and integration with Spring's AOP features.

13. What is the Scope of a Bean? and list the examples for each scope.

    Bean scope determines the lifecycle and visibility of a bean within the application contexts. The main scopes are:

    - **Singleton:** (Default) One instance per Spring IoC container.
    - **Prototype:** A new instance each time a bean is requested.
    - **Request:** One instance per HTTP request (web-aware applications).
    - **Session:** One instance per HTTP session (web-aware applications).
    - **Global session:** One instance per global HTTP session (portlet context).

14. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? 

    <bean id="beanId" class="com.example.ClassName">
        <property name="dependency" ref="anotherBean"/>
    </bean>

    For a bean with dependencies, you can use the `<property>` tag to inject other beans either by reference (`ref`) if the dependency is another bean or by value (`value`) for primitive and String values. Constructor injection can be achieved using `<constructor-arg>` tags.
