3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
   AOP allows separation of cross-cutting concerns by additional behavior to existing code (an advice) without modifying the code itself, instead separately specifying which code is modified via a "pointcut" specification. This allows for behaviors that cut across the typical divisions of responsibility, such as logging, error handling, or security,
4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
   Advantages of using AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) for a project include improved code readability, easier maintenance, and a more modular approach to programming. AOP can also make it easier to handle cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, authentication, authorization, and transaction management.

    Disadvantages of using AOP include the complexity of implementing and debugging AOP, as well as potential performance issues due to the overhead of the AOP implementation. Additionally, AOP is not supported by all programming languages, so developers may have to use a library or framework to enable AOP in their language.

5. What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
   Aspect: An aspect is a class that implements enterprise application concerns that cut across multiple classes, such as transaction management.

6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
   Pointcut: Pointcut is expressions that are matched with join points to determine whether advice needs to be executed or not

7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
   A Joinpoint is a point in Spring AOP during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception, etc. This symbolizes a point in your web application where you can easily plug in the AOP aspect of your software. In Spring AOP, a JoinPoint always represents a method execution.
8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
   In Spring AOP, advice is an action that an aspect takes at a particular joinpoint. It is a piece of code that is executed during program execution, either before or after the method execution.

10. When to use Spring Batch?
    atch processing works well in situations where you don't need real-time analytics results, and when it is more important to process large volumes of information than it is to get fast analytics results.
11. How Spring Batch works?
    it is comprehensive set of features to help of batch processing.
    1. job define
    2. job exe
    3. job monitor
    4. failue handling
12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
    1. `annotation` use @EnableScheduling
    2. `create method` and use annotation of @Scheduled
13. What is the cron expression?
    A cron expression is a string of six or seven fields that describe a schedule's details. it has three parts.
14. What is the spring task?
    Spring Task is typically used when you need to schedule and execute tasks or jobs at specific intervals or times within a Spring application.
15. When to use Spring task?
    1. when need asychornized task.
    2. when need concurrency.
    3. when need scheduling
    4. when need high thoughput
16. What is Filter and any filter example?
    in spring, there is filter chain. it can fitler the request in order.

    ```java
    import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
    import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
    import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;

    @Configuration
    @EnableWebSecurity
    public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

        @Override
        protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
            // Configure security settings and specify filters
            http
                .authorizeRequests()
                    .antMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
                    .anyRequest().authenticated()
                    .and()
                .formLogin()
                    .loginPage("/login")
                    .permitAll()
                    .and()
                .logout()
                    .logoutSuccessUrl("/logout-success");
        }
    }

    ```

17. What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
    it can allow us to capture and manipulate the request and response objects during the processing of a request. Interceptors are often used in web frameworks, such as Spring MVC, to perform pre-processing and post-processing tasks around the execution of a handler (typically a controller method). In the case of Spring MVC, interceptors are part of the request processing pipeline and can be used to perform various tasks before and after the execution of a controller method.
    we can use interceptor for:
    1. pre proccesing
    2. post processing
    3. loging
18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?

    In Spring MVC, the `HandlerInterceptor` interface provides three methods that allow you to perform tasks at different stages of the request processing lifecycle. Two of these methods are `preHandle` and `postHandle`.
    1. **preHandle:**
       - The `preHandle` method is called before the actual handler (controller method) is executed. It provides an opportunity to perform pre-processing tasks before the controller logic is invoked.
       - The method signature is as follows:

         ```java
         boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) throws Exception;
         ```

       - The `preHandle` method returns a boolean value. If `true` is returned, the request processing continues, and the actual handler (controller) is executed. If `false` is returned, the request processing is stopped, and the controller is not invoked.
       - Common use cases for `preHandle` include authorization checks, logging, modifying the request, and setting up attributes for use in the controller.

       Example of a simple `preHandle` implementation:

       ```java
       @Override
       public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) throws Exception {
           // Perform pre-processing tasks
           // For example, check if the user is authenticated
           if (!userIsAuthenticated()) {
               // Redirect to the login page
               response.sendRedirect("/login");
               return false; // Stop further processing
           }
           return true; // Continue with the execution chain
       }
       ```

    2. **postHandle:**
       - The `postHandle` method is called after the handler (controller method) has been invoked but before the view is rendered. It provides an opportunity to perform post-processing tasks on the model and view.
       - The method signature is as follows:

         ```java
         void postHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler,
                         ModelAndView modelAndView) throws Exception;
         ```

       - The `postHandle` method does not influence the execution flow. It is invoked regardless of whether the `preHandle` method returned `true` or `false`. This method is useful for tasks like modifying the model or view, logging, or performing cleanup operations.

       Example of a simple `postHandle` implementation:

       ```java
       @Override
       public void postHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler,
                               ModelAndView modelAndView) throws Exception {
           // Perform post-processing tasks
           // For example, add a common attribute to the model
           if (modelAndView != null) {
               modelAndView.addObject("commonAttribute", "This is a common attribute");
           }
       }
       ```

    These interceptor methods (`preHandle` and `postHandle`) provide a way to customize the request processing flow before and after the execution of the controller method, allowing developers to implement additional logic based on the specific needs of the application.
