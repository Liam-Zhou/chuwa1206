3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
   Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that allows modularizing cross-cutting concerns, 
   such as logging, security, and transactions, by separating them from the main business logic.

4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
   - Advantages:
     - Improved modularity by separating cross-cutting concerns.
     - Reusability of aspects across different modules.
     - Better maintenance and readability of code.
    - Disadvantages:
      - Potential complexity in understanding and managing aspects.
      - Runtime overhead due to dynamic weaving.

5. What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
    - An aspect in Spring AOP is a module that encapsulates cross-cutting concerns. It contains advice and is often associated with specific join points using pointcut expressions.

6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
    - A pointcut is an expression that defines a set of join points. In Spring AOP, it specifies where the advice should be applied in the application.

7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
    - A join point is a specific point in the execution of a program, such as method invocation or exception handling. In Spring AOP, join points are the points where advice can be applied.

8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
    - Advice in Spring AOP is the action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. Types of advice include "before," "after," "around," "after-returning," and "after-throwing."

10. When to use Spring Batch?
    - Spring Batch is suitable for processing large volumes of data efficiently, especially for batch-oriented and offline processing tasks.
11. How Spring Batch works?
    - Spring Batch provides a framework for developing robust batch processing applications by breaking down the process into smaller, manageable chunks.
12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
    - Spring Batch jobs can be scheduled using external schedulers like cron, or integrated with Spring's scheduling capabilities using `@Scheduled` annotations.
13. What is the cron expression?
    - A cron expression is a string representing a schedule based on the standard cron format. It defines the timing for executing a task, with fields like minutes, hours, days, etc.
14. What is the spring task?
    - Spring Task Execution is a feature that allows scheduling tasks in a Spring application, providing a simplified interface for scheduling repetitive tasks.
15. When to use Spring task?
    - Spring Task Execution is useful when there is a need to schedule and execute periodic or repetitive tasks in a Spring application.
16. What is Filter and any filter example?
    - In Java web development, a filter is a component that performs filtering tasks on the request and response of a servlet. An example could be a logging filter that logs information about incoming requests.
17. What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
    - An interceptor is a component that intercepts the processing of a request and can perform pre-processing, post-processing, or modify the response. It's often used for tasks like authentication, logging, or modifying headers
18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
    - In an interceptor, `preHandle` is a method that is executed before the actual handler method is called. `postHandle` is a method executed after the handler method but before rendering the view.
19. What is Swagger?
    - Swagger is a tool for designing, building, and documenting APIs. It provides a standard way to describe RESTful APIs using a common language, allowing both humans and computers to understand the capabilities of a service without access to its source code.
